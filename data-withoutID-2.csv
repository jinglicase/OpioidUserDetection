1,1,1,1,None,Yes they affect me similar to how they affect you It like normal people are at baseline and get super dumb and fucked up but I already have crippling anxiety so lots of benzos just get me to normal and I ve never really gotten super fucked up even on large doses Like you said it s like being drunk I ve taken LOTS of benzos before and never broke the law or made an ass of myself while other people I know blackout on like 2 Xanax and crash their car and steal shit I ve forgotten things similar to how you forget when your drunk but I ve never black out and never feel the need to abuse benzos They are normalizers to me When I did it I was playing black ops 2 and for a good 15 minutes I swear I was playing left 4 dead 2 Oof I ve had the police hallucinations more times than I d like Once on a coke binged I looked out my window and it was fine then I got a bad feeling in my stomach and went to look again only to see at least 3 fully black shadow cop cars and at least 7 10 cops all shining lights Crazy shit ,black

1,1,1,1,None,How do you come to that conclusion Even as I child I ve been interested in science spirituality the human mind and hallucinogenic plants As a teenager I began the exploration on occasion every 3 6 months Before I ve consumed any drug I ve researched it to the point that most people don t know I used to be addicted to cigarettes but LSD gave me the motivation to quit as I could feel tar coating my lungs stealing what felt like about 20 of my air a horrible sounding cough and a weird not able to clear my throat feeling when I was tripping it was more subtle but noticeable sober hyperaware of the damage it was causing Now I have a much reduced cough which doesnt sound that bad and only a slight need to clear my throat feeling and I smoke a lot of weed I do use about 1 cig worth mixed tbh but that s much better than 10 20 non water filtered smokes a day Besides that I know what opiates do to people from research and seeing meeting a few addicts out there I ve tried a couple out of pure 1 2x experimentation to see why people like the shit Codeine was strong but gave me SEVERE upper stomach pain and spins trams had no euphoria and slowed my breathing to an uncomfortable but non lethal level and oxy was okay it had no side effects and mild euphoria and and a nod which caused realistic but boring dreams within seconds of me on my phone or something and the 2nd time my friends and I snorted some and we all became agitated easily and unmotivated with no other effects To me they don t feel good nor serve any good purpose to my health or mind To me psychedelics are my DOC I like things that are interesting feel good spiritual and useful Being half relaxed to unable to leave the lounge in a boring but content way is not my style I ve got weed to feel good and relax me and it s much more satisfying safe and it s got a psychedelic edge to it which I love ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,I mean yeah I suppose generally speaking I think most people would advise you to steer clear of opiates What s wrong with getting free fentanyl Either you get an opioid buzz or you die either way it s a win win Hydrocodone isn t really that strong of an opiate which is probably why you haven t overdosed on that combo I ve generally found that alcohol high dose benzodiazepines blackouts and high dose of a potent opiate benzodiazepines respiratory depression I didn t have a big tolerance when this happened and I took what would ve been equivalent to about 120mg oxy and 10mg Xanax ,opiates^opioid^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Opiates shrinks the pupils allthough alot it also takes a bot of the edge away from the acid Used to smoke some opium sometimes during trips just for the soothin effect Do it they are super reliable as well they have one that tests for opiates cannabis benzos and amphetamines and one more that looks for residues of other substances on a wider spectrum From what i heard oil paintings rarely do aquarelle usually looks much nicer Allthough it does depend from artist to artist as well In color i dont think it would be too good but black and grey might just rock it Dont take too much though i used opium but i dunno how lsd reacts to other opiates Since it doesn t affect the same receptors and so on i dont think it shold be a issue but u can never be too safe ,opium^opiates^black
1,1,1,1,None,Well it wasn t ash I guess I shouldn t have said it was completely cashed The weed in the pipe had been completely roasted black but it was still there it hadn t disintegrated I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I mean for being the poster child of racial equality in America it seems that people don t give a fuck about these wonderful words anymore That goes for black and white people The civil rights movement and the following cultural evolution intended on making people of all colors and creeds equal They weren t fighting for a switcheroo where black people would judge white people for the color of their skin Hell I imagine that after going through all that actual prejudice the last thing you d wanna do is inflict that same prejudice on others I d also like to think that those activists envisioned a world where their race and culture didn t need to be superficially propped up the way that I see many white institutions doing now as if to say aww look at all the little minorities and their wonderful cultureeee or let us give you arbitrary advantages because you re clearly not smart enough to do this on your own based on your own character ,black
0,0,0,0,None,Hmmm idk most substances affect more than one system in the brain including the ones you listed ex meth affects dopamine Norepinephrine and serotonin system Some dissociatives also affect serotonin and dopamine systems or even interact with opioid receptors Not just NMDA Maybe which substance is your favorite in each class that would make more sense ,opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Oh I won t getting it is a hassle for me in any case and I lean towards poly use rather than just opiates excluding weed I usually take something once or twice before feeling like moving to something else in my rota codeine thus far has been no exception Might indeed be as another comment said that I just don t metabolize codeine properly since 200mg weed wasn t enough to make me nod with no tolerance ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Felt this This is me with opiates tho Don t get me wrong I love stimulants but opiates kill it all away without keeping me up for days fighting off the FBI agents from breaking into my house I mean even if you excluded the part about your dreams the fact that he stopped his truck to make eye contact with you is probably enough to at least have them create a report for the incident That s creepy Especially given that you were fourteen at the time What s your point The SS enforced under the guise that Jews were less than humans and should be treated as such American police are not trained as such In the early 20th century if you called the cops because a black guy didn t give up his seat for you the guy would be beaten and arrested So what That was years and years and years ago Things have changed Comparing american law enforcement to the SS is what I would call grasping at straws Who are we supposed to call then Nobody Just put up our fists and hope for the best Maybe we should abolish the police And create some kind of organized trained group of individuals who are given the authority to enforce law and protect our citizens Some criminals have guns so these people would obviously have to come prepared more prepared than the perpetrators they face We could give them firearms But criminals aren t the only problem traffic violations kill thousands of people a year so obviously we d have to give this group their own marked vehicles to get around quickly and to enforce traffic laws Again to keep people safe See what I m getting at Police are a necessary part of any civilization Some are bad most are good Do a little research and you ll learn that I m not just some cop loving racist twat I hope this is true I feel his presence sometimes When I listen to certain music or go certain places I especially feel it in my dreams I had this dream once where I was with him and another friend whom is still alive and suddenly I realized I was dreaming and as soon as I did they both stopped what they were doing and looked straight at me I looked at him and said you re here he nodded But aren t you supposed to be and he just nods as if he was expecting the question I went to reach out and touch him but I woke up probably from the excitement I really want to believe it was really him and he was really there with me dipshit with a notepad who doesn t know how to handle their firearm Lol you re real fucking dense if you think cops don t know how to handle their firearms Maybe some don t but like 90 of them do Have you seen that video of the homeless guy holding up a store with a knife and the cop uses a 40mm round to literally shoot the knife out of his hand Cops have to be trained vigorously to handle their firearms learn trigger and muzzle discipline and accuracy If you actually did some research instead of watching all the viral videos of cops shooting black people you might actually gain some insight into the world of law enforcement Think for yourself don t be a sheep Don t believe all the Twitter videos that have no context or insight done into them Cops save lives Some doctors fuck up and ruin peoples lives do we have an acronym for that ADAB No Because we know they are the vast minority We just don t have a bunch of videos on Twitter of doctors botching surgeries My childhood pediatrician literally molested his patients and his own granddaughter and had a toy on his stethoscope with a camera in it that recorded his patients in compromising positions probably including myself Do I think he s a complete bastard who deserves to rot in hell Absofuckinglutely Do I think all doctors are bastards who deserve to rot in hell Absolutely not But you might say but cops are given guns and given the authority to shoot people Blue man bad Doctors are given the authority to touch peoples genitals nipples see their patients naked Surgeons are given the authority to literally put people to sleep cut open their bodies and manipulate their insides Some of them fuck up Do we bastardize them No Use your brain Cops are humans Some are racist some are misogynistic some are murderers some are rapists Doctors are humans Some are racist some are misogynistic some are murderers some are rapists Same with lawyers engineers scientists construction workers that one weird cashier who checked your shit at walmart My point is cops are humans like the rest of us Some of them are bound to fuck up to be evil to use their authority to do wrong And such individuals should be recognized and face the consequences If humans are bastards some cops are gonna be bastards If you ever god forbid get into a serious accident and require CPR at the scene and wake up to a cop doing chest compressions on you I sincerely hope your attitude changes I m gonna get downvoted to shit but fuck it it needs to be said Hard disagree I ve met some shithead cops don t get me wrong But I ve also met some pretty great cops too Cops that should ve taken me to jail but didn t Cops that should ve given me a ticket but didn t I agree police reform is an important issue but I also think that saying all cops are bad is shortsighted ignorant and dangerous Cops get killed all the time because they re worried what the public will think if they kill someone dangerous especially if they happen to be black or latinx innocent people die because of shit like this People block streets preventing emergency service vehicles from passing protesting deaths even though the police took lawful action Again I ve met a lot of shithead cops The cop that killed Philando Castile was a shithead That cop that shot that woman during a wellness check was a dumbass Don t promote hate for law enforcement push for better training for police officers more sensitivity training for police officers ,opiates^dreams^black

0,0,0,0,None,This is how I feel about my dog I m a bit biased I love cats but I feel that it s easier to make that connection with a dog for myself I rescued my Pit Mix on March 14th 2015 and that was the day her foster mom came over to do the home check I had volunteered on Saturdays at the Petco near my house because of Community Service I had to complete 25 hours Not bad So what you d do when you volunteered there is it would just be a circle of metal chairs set up and we d all sit there with the dog that we were assigned and we would educate potential adopters customers of the store about the dogs They were really relaxed there they d let me take as many cigarette breaks as I wanted and they d just let me walk around the store which I d do So one time when I was walking around the store and I went towards the back of it in the very back corner there was a woman with a medium sized tan and black dog The dog s nipples were about 2 cm from touching the floor ground for the fact that at that time spring of 2015 but a couple weeks before I started volunteering she had 9 puppies Anyways I had went up to them and sat to pet Ginger and talk to her foster mom Bobbie and every Saturday that I volunteered after that I would continue that I swear it was written in the stars Something made me go over by them the initial time and every time after that For the most part when I d sit with Ginger and Bobbie Ginger wouldn t even really pay me attention And EVERY dog that walked by puppy adult dog nice dog she would bark and lunge extremely aggressively To the point where I haven t ever heard her bark that way since seeing her there at that Petco And she s always loved puppies she still dies for them So anyway after a couple weeks of volunteering and sitting by Ginger and Bobbie Bobbie said something I will never forget Hey Patsy you should fill out an application for Ginger And I did A couple weeks probably two at the most after filling out an application for her Bobbie and Gin came over for the home check on March 14th 2015 I still remember it After about 2 1 2 hours of talking and filling out some paperwork etc Ginger was mine She is the best girl in the entire world and I know every animal owner says that But it was funny because before Christmas of 2019 obviously my Ginger had never really met a baby baby a few month old baby But my girlfriend Amber actually came over with her and my other friend Jamie a couple days before Christmas and it was SO CUTE Amber has a 2 year old and an 8 or so month old and when they came over Ginger had went by Azo her 8mo and gave him THE Softest most GENTILE kisses in the entire world Oh my God it was so so sooooo gorgeous She s just my life and my word It was just so adorable to see her be so gentile with him even though she s always soo gentile I love my Ginger Virginia Beautiful cat by the way and it anyone actually read this far thank you Lol Congratulations on taking the first step towards recovery wanting sobriety I m proud of you And just so you know there probably will be people near where your parents live that use opiates It s almost inevitable even in the nicer neighborhoods But that doesn t mean you need to partake Also I personally have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to do use opiates or Heroin recreationally or once a month etc It just doesn t work because the only on Friday each week for example turns into Grabs 3 bags Friday afternoon for all of that day and that night Then let s say I have a 5 10 tolerance like I used to well I m gonna do a bag or a bag and a half and be fucked up so that turns into me having a bag or a bag and a half left when Saturday rolls around So with that being said I don t think I would be able to use without continuing my use Unless that one time just showed reminded me of how shitty using was and how shitty my life was back then To conclude congratu fuckin lation on taking the first and one of the most important steps toward in recovery I think you ll do amazing so to speak as long as it s what you want and what you continue to strive for I don t have a hard time with comprehension whatsoever Not sure why you re being condescending Anyways I agree People places things Edit I guess I worded my comment wrong I don t think that everyone is the same is why in response to a different person I d said that everyone s different but I personally am 14mo into my recovery from H and very clearly I m still on here But here is different than opiates church and even there there s not much porn pictures Edit Not many porn pictures that I ve seen ,black^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,It depends My bud who threw caution to the wind and just chugged shares the same ideals as you But it is really about finding a balance and taking breaks Take LSD you really want to wait a month in between trips Do it to much too often and it loses its effect and harms you Take too much thc and you build up a tolerance and have to stop it for around four weeks to get back to normal It only seems crazy to us because we are not around it Were in Turkey and Napal and around the Black Sea it is common known Even used as medicine by some people I am guessing your teacher was big on say no to drugs as well So he she did not want the kids getting any ideas ergo it is poison it can kill there is nothing but evil about it So no worries You are correct it does come with some warnings around it but it is in no way as dangerous as most of the other stuff on this sub Will do good sir madam Sorry It took so long for me to respond I saw your post this morning but I have the cold flu right now so I swear I responded until now when I check the thread Any who My order has been delayed because of the outbreak in china The honey was beeing shipped from Turkey to China to a slow boat to me But that has been delayed I have it on my things to do that once I find the right dose and trip I will come back and tell you all my experience I am not going to add grams taken or anything like that I think This is because each jar each batch has a different lvl of Grayanotoxins the stuff that makes you trip So adding a g BMI will in truth hurt more that it will help The best thing to do is do what my doctor told me To try one tea spoon then increase it after waiting a week Do this until you trip Then wait a month and check the dose If you have the same experience then you will not have a tolerance problem Because I plan on taking it once a month If it is much more intense then there is a tolerance but it is under a month so I will be safe If it has no effect decreased effect then experiment over Because that means that the tolerance levels can build and stay over long periods of time this increases the chance for od and dangerous levels of doses Then you only want to use it once every six months to a year Because I am going for the trip and not the medicinal effects the tolerance level is important Where if I was going for the medicinal effects the trip tolerance would be welcomed Wow bud this is really long sry about that TL DR I will do it but I am not getting the shipment until march so it could be as late as may before the trail is done Man I use a cheap ass 50 buck echo Like one of the worst thing people say not to buy It works like a dream though Gets about 9 smokes to a full charge Easy to clean easy to fill and dump Ceramic heating holding I love the thing I have tried a few others that friends shown me They wanted me to change all snub nose n the little echo But man that thing hits and works I know cheap china made bla bla bla But TBH all the others are made in china Most likely at the same plants I just ordered this other weird looking pipe like one from China as well The reviews are mixed on it and it may only get three tanks per charge But it just looks so damn cool redwood and pipe shaped all that So don t feel bad Just do what works for you ,black^china

1,1,1,1,None,I started investigating the social panic the USA experienced in the 50 60s that is often mocked by modern media omg did you accidentally bring home a communist in your groceries Type stupid paranoia x200B Only in reality it wasn t baseless paranoia Soviet psy op agents HAD infiltrated universities and Hollywood they would operate out of almost every Soviet embassy or were recruited from Russian communities in the USA even second gen immigrants One of these was behind almost every single communist society or students for marxism type group at the head you had a literal propaganda agent who got their marching orders from the Soviets x200B To be fair most of the US citizens recruited were just idealistic fools useful idiots or were just childishly rebelling against the USA in some way None of them openly realized they were basically pscy op shit stirrers for the SU and in fact many would vehemently revile many of the cultural and societal attitudes of the SU if they knew The ideas and values the SU was spreading among academics were ones they would never have allowed to flourish in their own country x200B A lot of this shit didn t really actually come to fruition until the last decade it took time to plant society ruining values The hardest thing is I AGREE with a lot of societal disruption goals the soviets had like encouraging gay rights the civil rights movement interracial relationships black power movements Basically the USA at the time and in a way still is a powder keg just waiting to be set off https www ozy com flashback when the soviet union tried to woo black america 62517 https www ozy com flashback when the soviet union tried to woo black america 62517 x200B If anyone is interested I can produce more links even showing the SU was behind the nascent gay rights movement very ironic when the SU was and still is VERY homophobic culture all the way to violence Right on a kindred spirit I think this is a big aspect behind the odd love hate experience some of these opiates induce Some people want nod and only nod if you re not making them nod you re a waste of money Some people love the energy etc I ve always wondered if there was a concrete uniform reason for the different actions across the entire board like you could just look at a novel RC opioid s binding profile and molecular weight and instantly know how it would feel subjectively on average Same mountains of studies and scientific evidence showing chronic use of opiates can actually worsen pain and perfection of pain True or not they are just used to justify sending dependent people to the street to die FWIW i don t even like benzos love me some gabapentinoids through She most likely did not let it absorb correctly like just swallowed it HOWEVER buprenorphine has a 10 oral bioavailability so as a total noob she still should have been hit HARD by 0 20mg of buprenorphine x200B My guess is either she is a liar one of those people who have atypical first responses to opiates a girl who once wanted me to initiate her had a moderate dose of codeine had no euphoria and instead got morose and was scaring me by saying stuff like she did not care whether a car driving by would slam into her and kill her O Or she just claimed to take it and really pocketed it because she wanted to look cool but was scared x200B For those concerned that girl never used opiates or other drugs to my knowledge and is alive and fine today with child Go to a bay known for pirates or one of the free streaming sites and watch the first two seasons of

years While the guests paying to come and act out their darkest fantasies is plenty profitable it is revealed that the hats and costumes guests wear have bands in them that are downloading their minds and keeping copies in massive hard drives in the park and one of the top secret projects is creating a stable working copy of a wealthy dead man and they are close There is also constant surveillance all around the park on quests in addition to the secret hat heads bands downloading their minds and thoughts They even have secret psychological profiles of all the quests we see The Man In Black given his by Ford and him reading it and its not flattering x200B Now google may not be able to create clones of the powerful and wealthy and insert them into society just yet BUT it has a massive amount of data about who is thinking about or searching for what even if you have no account they have a record of that IP and what it searched for and did online What is google decides to monetive this directly This is the world largest source of blackmail material Wanna know what world ruler jerks it daily to porn of black guys feet Well you can for a fee Wanna know what this new potential hire is searching for Eh its worth ten bucks omg searches on how to safely IV heroin No thank you best ten bucks we ever spent x200B And its just getting worse and worse and worse by the day children are being raised for it to be normalized that machines with mics are monitoring your every word just for the convenience of being able to ask Alexa what the temp will be tonight verbally This post was inspired by years of interaction and listening to people gossip about others sharing their true feelings and man it was depressing x200B But then my mostly estranged sister we are NOT estranged due to drug abuse shit like asking for money etc my wife called her to ask her to get me to stop taking all these pills for my mood like the tiny amount of buprenorphine I take a day they are even suspicious of stuff from the supplement section at walmart Hmm Vitamin D3 L Arginine Magnesium Glycinate obviously just subtle ways to catch a buzz These druggies are crafty My sister told me she knew I never quit taking drugs from when I was a teenager exploring opiates while escaping my abusive controlling parents She told me this is why she tried to grab the entire pitiful inheritance after my parents deaths I did not need the money which I would just blow on ordering crazy chemicals like phenibut what is that some gay anus thing like poppers She then told me that I obviously don t love my child which I am the primary caregiver for 100 financially support I only care about maintaining my own mood first If I loved him I d stop taking everything even vitamins and put the money toward dubious therapies toward his disability I d get 3 hell 4 full time jobs and not eat to get as much money as possible for treatments and not care about myself my wife btw barely does online work bringing in a few hundred a month I eat nothing but beans and rice and food on the clearance rack x200B I broke down emotionally screaming and crying over the phone to the point neighbors thought it was a domestic telling her how dare she who has told me only tell her good things she doesn t want to hear depressing parts of my life with my disabled son Then she snarkily went OOOOOOOOOOOOOO look whose screaming and crying now you re probably high right this moment which is why I was finally able to break through to you and get you to cry haha This just set me off further I had been looking to her my older sister for emotional guidance and support but instead got sniped at just like my parents used to do She was also furious I got her daughter who was a blackout alcoholic spending 50 bucks a day at the bar turned on to baclofen and her daughter said its amazing a baclofen a day along with a wellbutrin and she hasn t had a desire to drink or go to the bar in weeks but stilll has to for social occasions at work but she baclofen helps her moderate herself My niece a major reason she wants to stop drinking is once a man took her home when she was blackout and she considers what happened rape saying she woke naked on a bed and she realized she needed out of this life which is a big reason I wanted to help her My sister was furious I m practicing medicine without a license and getting her daughter to order crazy uncontrolled drugs online from sketchy drug dealers She said let her drink herself to death its what she deserves BTW the wellbutrin and baclofen are RXed to her by her DOCTOR he also RXs her clonazepam and gabapentin which my niece said she no longer feels any need for or desire to take but she will stock pile it for the future x200B This is also the woman who lost custody of her son because she hung herself in the garage and she was the only adult around except for her teenage son who came home and found and saved her and called 911 This is also the woman who has had every drug in existence RXed to her for fibromyalgia including fent patches and xyrem yes RX GHB and 80mg oxys back in the day and dilaudids and benzos and soma the list never ends I helped her endless times like when her husband called me because she had been overusing her RXed amount of fent patches wearing multiple at once then had a fight with him and in the heat of the fight she flushed all her pads and even ripped the ones she had on off He said she just laid on the floor for days moaning and vomiting and emiting diarrhea at the same time and he did not know what to do I helped her but she went to the ER eventually She buys pot in a felony state and smokes daily But I am a dirty evil drug addict x200B My wife also hates when I take anything from a vitamin bought off the clearance rack of a health food store or anything else pill like vaguely you should feel how you naturally feel if vitamin D3 makes you feel better thats unatural and wrong x200B I try to avoid my family I became a digital nomad to escape Human weakness is fed off of by human strength and I m not being literal of course This is why communism on a size large than a family group falls apart we re designed to play this game x200B edit To make it perfectly clear I am NOT defending daily benzo use for anxiety however here we are and a lot of people are dependent on their scripts Stable dependent and functioning for decades and ALIVE Now if they are all yanked off cold turkey and run to street Thats what I m against Provisions should be made for those already dependent as their lives depend on it Just like with opiates My guess is that gabapentin will become the new go to for generalized anxiety until it too is scheduled and cracked down and around and around we go Pharmaceutical companies in the USA have been playing this game a LONG TIME remember morphine was the non addictive replacement for that evil addictive opium Then they introduced heroin to move the morphine addicts to and Check out what is going on in China right now they are arresting labs for selling caffeine powder according to the SARM subs Some kind of far reaching legislation against providing chemicals in raw form or something Illicit supply of anything is delicate You also assume potential consumers are as informed and sophisticated as posters here I mean in the recent past there are people including celebrities buying pressed xans that are really fentalog off the street in probably the golden age of not only RX benzos but RC benzos too I tend to apply a sort of filtering method to these tolerance or potentiators of the day that I have seen countless numbers of come into and out of style turn out to be bunk turn out to be real and everything in between I suspect there has been a LOT of guerilla marketing going on over the years if you catch my drift Anyone remember when Cat s Claw got to the point of flyers up in methadone clinics x200B Whether the thing is worth trying is mostly based on cost proposed benefit and potential downsides like are there are reports of potential liver toxicity etc If its cheap enough or enough of a commodity and has a high enough proposed benefit and no reports of downsides might be worth trying But most of this shit is flash in the pan nonsense or actual bad faith astroturfing There have also been actual cases of methadone or some obscure opioid or RC opioid being found in these chinese herb blends that would make the rounds on the boards for halting tolerance increase x200B There are a couple supplements I will defend with my life like vitaminD3 just based on cost potential benefit and subjective possibly placebo effect no matter what new studies come out and are touted by the anti supplement brigade I m not a total robot There is no worldwide monolithic zionist jew cabal working on a singular goal of world domination for thousands of years thats silly and beneath discussion x200B There are however concentrations of jews in certain industries with wide reach and importance that should give people pause and most of these groups have goals totally at crosssections anyway A republican duel USA Israeli citizen working high up in middle east affairs in the state department advocating for more middle east adventures to fight Israel s enemies for them isn t going to have much in common with a super liberal and woke atheist jew in NYC who writes articles about whether your cat is genderfluid or not x200B A few years ago I started paying attention to these bizarre almost social engineering propaganda articles about bizarre sex or family arrangements It takes a true intellectual to enjoy watching your wife getting pleased by a black bull and googling the author and heh yup jewish The articles would often come out in bunches so it was obvious these authors had some discord or forum somewhere they were talking about and co ordinating this crap that seemed designed just to agitate or rile up people I got bored of it when a really bizarre group of articles appeared advocating an insect based diet googled the authors and well look at that Amusingly the chick who wrote the article for VICE freely admitted she got really sick and ill on this diet for future plebs when she tried to live off of it a week lol This came out of nowhere and seemed to be a floater almost testing what the public will accept x200B Variations on this have been floating around for years not sure if this is the same one but once I actually looked into it and most accounts and tweets could be confirmed as real https pbs twimg com

intended only for jewish consumption like the fact young jews outbreeding is a second holocaust https mondoweiss net 2019 07 intermarriage holocaust conversion https mondoweiss net 2019 07 intermarriage holocaust conversion x200B Anyway this has been your sick anti semitic alt right post of the day Oral opium is my favorite opiate of all time I have grown poppies and tried to harvest opium I have followed and participated in long long threads of others doing the same in a backyard context with one or few workers and always ending in failure or at least disappointment Its a waste of time if you want a heroin type nod an even greater waste x200B However Growing and consuming papaver somniferum pods green or dried works perfectly and is both rewarding and will get you high Warning withdrawal is horrendous for the high you get which I like just fair warning that trying to cold turkey pods is a quick path to fent or heroin addiction Have subs or methadone ON HAND x200B The corporations that currently grow p somniferum for the alkaloids just harvest the entire plant with machines at what they assume is the peak of alkaloid content which varies like a mofo then grind the pods and other plant material they catch the seeds for sale to the food industry then heat and chemically process the poppy straw to extract the alkaloids x200B Doing things the old fashioned way was more art than science in predicting weather top opium flow rate and required vast amounts of highly trained and otherwise useless seasonal work force to manually lance the pods and collect the opium after AKA Afghani slave girls daughters After this the raw opium was dried manipulated exposed to sun and otherwise esoterically processed It would be further processed and treated each time it changed hands from the farm all the way to the local opium den Where the owners and servers often had their own esoteric processing methods and even pre heating before it reached consumers Books have been written about this there were entire industries making all sorts of esoteric tools like there is no in the legal weed industry I ve seen claims such as tests at the time showed some alkaloids did not even vaporize at the temps some dens were using so some people might have basically been vaping morphine while others were vaping papaverine mostly or who even knows what The mystique of opium involved a lot of social bullshit just like alcohol does now https commons wikimedia org wiki File Confiscated opium pipes in Hawaii c 1920 jpg https commons wikimedia org wiki File Confiscated opium

18 antique sterling silver opium chatelaine tools mystery lock box rare chinese x200B My advice This whole period and way of drug use is gone and extinct and it would take industrial level activity to bring it back However orally consuming pods green or dry is wonderful and gives a great subtle energizing high My advice is to spread washed poppy seeds from PST far and wide near you look up the correct planting time and they love disturbed soil Just return and harvest when the pods are ready Will this be your first EVER opiate experience If you re a small body size take 1 pill and don t combo it with anything get a feel for the opiate experience If you have a large body size take 2 or 1 and a half for the first time x200B There is a limit to both how much codeine can be metabolized by each body AT ONCE and over a 24 hour period Those numbers you see for 300 400mg thats either a rare super metabolizer or a 24 hour metabolism rate edit Some seem to be misunderstanding that in the

3,1,1,1,None,My opinion up until recently there was little money to be made in studying addiction or treatment Opiate detox was an unwanted burden to be disposed of as soon as possible So there is a lot of guesswork Almost all opiates are schedule II controlled substances and the perception is that doctors risk losing their licenses and even criminal prosecution for being involved in prescribing opiates Our justice system needs some serious reform The question I have is will you end up just substituting kratom for opiates Personally I would love to use kratom to get off oxys I have tried kratom before and it did nothing for me as far as a high goes But if I could use it to get through withdrawal and then just quit kratom that would be awesome Imo NAD is a very expensive scam From what I have seen they talk about people feeling better after 5 or 6 days of iv therapy The problem is you are going to feel better anyway after 5 or 6 days in most cases Cost is between 5 10k depending on length of treatment Ibogaine is the only treatment I have read about for opiate addiction that seems to cut out withdrawal symptoms and cravings It is also expensive and you have to go to Mexico or Canada to do it I would definitely think you need to go more slowly for a long acting opiate From what I have seen if you take an opiate for more than 6 months you have a much better chance of avoiding relapse if you do a gradual detox Heroin is never going to be legalized unless the problem gets much much worse Marijuana had investors willing to lobby for years No such luck with heroin There is no money to be made and as such no spokesmen to push congress to change the law Everyone that matters meaning cops politicians and cartel people have a vested interest in keeping it illegal If the opium epidemic got bad enough maybe it would be decriminalized But as it stands now that dog won t hunt What influences the amount of time an opioid binds to a receptor Is that just a characteristic of that chemical I would bring in a really good chiropractor that can test your muscles and tell you which ones need strengthening One thing I have learned about PT and chiros they tend to work towards the lowest common denominator Meaning the exercises they prescribe are a one size fits all solution If you are young and strong you may need to bump it up Yoga is super helpful Not your grandaddy s yoga but some of the more intense methods like hot yoga Working on balance really helped me because the same muscles in your feet and legs that let you balance are muscles involved in how you use your back If you have already tried other stuff my prescription would be 1 Intense yoga 2 High doses of tumeric with black pepper and 3 A month of really clean eating A lot of people would tell you that you can never go back to tramadol and other drugs of abuse I don t know I would give abstinence at least 30 days In the meantime you can try other stuff if you want You didn t mention anything about your diagnosis but there have been many many people that have conquered their back pain with exercise and smart treatment I haven t had any interaction with addiction medicine docs in years but I have to admit it always seemed sketchy I am glad there are at least some doctors who are willing to put the work in to understand opiates Which is the reason why I had to ask this question about tapering in the first place There are some very well educated people that are absolutely convinced that it is impossible to get off opiates without that big kick at the end The theory that was presented to me was that the body cannot start producing endogenous opioids until the receptors are completely clear of outside compounds So if you take even 10 mg of oxy for example that will set you back until it is eliminated from the body and whatever signaling process we use to manufacture natural opioids resumes once more I was told that this is what they teach in medical school even though it is not really logical and contradicts many many people on reddit especially the numerous accounts of kratom users who have used that substance to get off opiates But as long as I have this opportunity to ask questions I would like to ask if you have any experience with the bridge device see link below or electro acupuncture to suppress withdrawal symptoms I have been reading about acupuncture and nerve stimulation of various sorts for years as a way to bypass withdrawal But the one thing I have never seen is a credible opiate addict saying that they beat addiction by using this method At one point I was so desperate that I bought a box of acupuncture needles and spent all morning sticking them into my ears in an attempt to obtain relief I also got a 9 volt battery and was trying to figure out the best way to pass a small current through my ears but gave up before I managed to find a workable method Any input https www medscape com answers 287790 85622 what is the role of the nss 2 bridge device in the treatment of opioid withdrawal Man I really appreciate your responding The thing with me is that I have been on opiates for several years and am now ready to get off I was once on methadone but for some reason any sort of opiate seems to drain me I don t have a normal amount of energy when I take them and I find it hard to do even regular life stuff like shopping or whatever I kicked cold turkey last year and stupidly relapsed I am not eager to cold turkey again because it was viciously painful But I am willing to suffer some to get clean I think maybe this time around my sobriety will be more valuable for me because I have to work for it And for me the opiate high simply is not worth all the pain that comes with it anymore So I am passing on substitute opiates I think it is the best decision in my case I am pointing people to your post on tapering which I hope is ok with you There is far too much opinion and not enough actual experience on this topic The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few unless you are talking about a very mild opiate that most people would never consider taking unless it was the only thing they could get

0,0,0,0,None, trying to argue that drug addiction is a survival need might be the most laughable thing you ve said in this entire thread It s a reasonable comparison for opiate addiction I actually got the idea from medical literature at my methodone clinic Opiate withdrawal is essentially your brain alerting your body that you are going to die if you don t get something asap Yes drugs are bad for you There I accounted for the damage done by the drugs themselves If only that was the only thing I had to worry about When you re an addict people treat ya like a lot of the commenters in this thread are treating me Addicts and homeless people are subhuman in today s society ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,That s true but in my case i find the positives outweigh the negatives because i already feel so low naturally even when i m not coming off anything Sometimes i even day dream about purposefully overdosing to kinda finish what i started I feel i ve done irreversible damage to my brain and i ll always have this chemical deficit and yearning for opiates It s just so hard man opiates dry out your mouth causing bacteria to flood your mouth since theres no saliva to work against it When i was using opiates heavily i got gingivitis because of it Drink lots of water floss and brush 2 3 times per day i ve tried both unfortunately ssris didn t do much for me and I got myself physically addicted to benzos for a long time when i was 16 That was my first real addiction and i was buying them off the street for therapeutic purposes at first but it spiralled out of control very fast I don t think benzos will ever be a good long term drug to soothe anxiety because of how horrible the dependence becomes I see you take them and i advise you to be safe because the withdrawal was worse than opiates in my opinion i ve heard dilaudid is very similar to heroin at least regarding strength and some opioid users PREFER shooting dilaudid over uncut H I ve been told dilaudid oxy is more euphoric than heroin I also find oxy is quite stimulating in low medium doses unlike dilaudid I found dilaudid was very sedating so i assume heroin is the same Theres a reason they call it down ,opiates^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Blame is pointless Just give people who are kicking opiates methadone Period That should be standard treatment everywhere jail or the streets It should be protocol in every jail and hospital and doctor s office No one should have to suffer from withdrawal symptoms ever I think if you took bupe after oxy or something too soon you would still go into PWD Even if you weren t addicted previously Im not sure but I d bet on it You d lose that bet Have you read the other replies You should How can you go into precipitated withdrawal if there is no way you can go into withdrawal Do you understand I don t think it has anything to do with regular withdrawal Uh it has everything to do with withdrawal It precipitates the withdrawal Do you know precipitates means for the most part I think it makes you sick beacuse you are on opioids currently and the bupe interferes The bupe prevents the opiates from getting on your receptors That doesn t matter if your Brain is producing normal amounts of dopamine which it would be doing if you are not addicted But if you are addicted your brain is not producing dopamine When the opiates can t get to your receptors and there is no dopamine being produced you go into withdrawal id go as far to say if you asked ANY sub doctor if an opiate nieve person took some oxy and a sub 3 hours later would they go into PWD in a non biased way they would all say yes If a sub doctor told me that and none ever has I d get a new doctor immediately Why don t you actually ask some sub doctors and find out Heck a doctor gave one of the replies on my thread He agrees with me If you argue with them a little they might alter what they said beacuse it s not worth pressing the matt Why would anyone do that Why do you believe things for which you have no evidence whatsoever Not true at all If you ve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start Not true at all If you ve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for three days and you absolutely will not get a physical dependency It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start Of course the fentanyl can kill you so why risk it I never get high from methadone either But it s a great way to kick without acute withdrawal symptoms Keep it around just in case you can t get your opiates You only need a few days worth of methadone to kick heroin or oxy with greatly reduced or no acute withdrawal symptoms You might need as little as 20 mgs a day for 3 to 5 days or more mgs but not days depending on your habit You can t get addicted to methadone in such a short time So hold onto it Keep it around for emergencies I snort 8 10 of them for my first dose and then usually do the rest about 6 8 hours later I am usually done ingesting them by midnight and pass out sometime after dawn I will sleep until 1 or 2PM and then take my suboxone an hour or so after waking up Is this something that would normally send people into precipitated wds Absolutely not You only get precipitated withdrawals if you are addicted to an opiate like heroin or oxy etc and then you take suboxone What you re doing doesn t cause pwd Not true at all If you ve never been physically dependent on opiates before you can use for a week and you will not get a physical dependency It can take a few weeks to get a physical dependency when you first start Also the kick on H is way shorter than percs What Not real percs it s not Kicking pills legitimate pharmaceuticals is much easier and shorter than kicking heroin Fent gets everyone fuck China for ruining opiates Fuck China for so many things They powers that be here in the US are definitely making it MUCH harder for anyone to be prescribed opiate pain medication but it s not actually illegal And that is a very important point There are doctors who will lie and say it is illegal These doctors are scared but that doesn t excuse lying What this poster was up to I don t know ,opiates^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Resist the urge to use You re doing really good getting to 4 days You will be able to sleep without opiates in time Maybe you can get another sleeping aid like a benzo The anxiety and cravings are normal Try to distract yourself and keep busy If you relapse now you might still be using when your partner gets out and they might end up relapsing Now you ve both got a chance to get clean It is amazing being free of constipation That was one of the worst side effects of opiates for me Congratulations on 4 weeks I m 1 day behind you Came really close to relapsing 3 times due to stress but somehow managed to resist For me the last symptom to go which I still get sometimes is sudden attacks of anxiety and sweats especially in the night I agree working out helps Even just as a way to fill the time you d normally spend in the opiate bubble I ve found them helpful I used them with opiates before I properly quit In one trip I saw myself standing in an open grave taking pills After each trip I had a greater desire to stop using and it felt easier the next day I have used them after stopping and found the experiences very cathartic and emotional They have helped me feel compassion for myself They help bring up and face the pain I was suppressing with opiates I ve had it with opiates but not tried it yet when clean I m interested though might give it a go u mrbrinks not sure if that will link properly has tried it Pregabalin clonidine are really good for acute withdrawals I switched to diazepam for a couple of days after that and found it very helpful But only use for a couple of days medicinally for sleep anxiety pain you don t want a habit for benzos as the WDs can be worse more dangerous than opiates Congratulations on 5 days clean It s nice knowing people can relate The opiates won t fix these problems It d just be a fake relief I think the only way is to just face it and do what we can Opiates can cause sphincter of Oddi dysfunction This can result in elevated liver enzymes and there are cases of pancreatitis which have been attributed to opiates Seems to be worse in people who have had their gallbladder removed https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5276812 Nice work you re doing really well A bit of kratoms a lot better than h I m struggling with depression too but I was depressed during my use too One thing I m trying to do which might be helpful to think about is be more accepting of feelings and try not to avoid them That s what opiates were for me Had a few mild trips while on opiates then stopped and had a 2 after the acute withdrawals first was fairly strong I ve been drinking since quitting opiates In the past there was a time when I slipped in to drinking a bit too much but I ve never had a problem or addiction to alcohol Only opioids I enjoy dinking socially sometimes Biggest issue with alcohol for me is the toxic side effects hangover is horrible and has been an excuse to use opiates in the past I also think it s a far inferior drug to opiates I have known people who had stopped drinking and then decided to have just 1 drink and ended up wasted on cocaine pills gambling going strip clubs etc within hours and going on a bender For some people alcohol really can lead them on a bad path fast I think you have to decide for yourself You are right Thanks for the advice It s just so hard to resist sometimes when I m stressed and start really considering the opiate escape Hopefully I can overcome this It is normal to feel depressed when you stop You are going through a big change And you ve been through a lot already Let yourself acknowledge the sadness and feel it while it is here and have a little faith that time will help it to pass Us opiate users spend so long numb to the world and our emotions that when we stop it overwhelms us I m at day 21 and still struggling with depression Best of luck If you want to stop I think you need to decide to get clean and commit to it Plan ahead Get the supplies you ll need food drinks comfort meds in advance You could try a slow or fast taper Accept that getting off the opiates will feel bad and give up your resistance to feeling bad You are not weak opiates are strong Best of luck to you You can do it I have some naltrexone I used it ULDN alongside dihydrocodeine for a couple of weeks before withdrawing last year Really helped reduce the diarrhoea at least I haven t tried it since stopping but I was thinking it might be a good idea Supposed to upregulate opioid receptors Keep it up power through Distract yourself Accept it and commit You will feel better soon You just have to give yourself the time to go through it then you ll feel healthy without opiates ,opiates^opiate^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,For tooth pain is Ibuprofen infact way better than an opioid Also IDK why you guys in the USA are acting like you need opioids for every small injurie here in my country the docs dont prescribe opis that much at all they first trie other pain pills and if they dont work they start giving you opioids and also they dont start with stronger ones like oxy they first trie Tramadol and Tilidin DHC and codeine mostly Tilidin And if they are also not working good enough then they start giving you oxy But yeah you guys got so used to battling every pain with Oxy thats insane And also if you get 4 wisdom teeth out here they give you Ibu 800mg and a script for 20x100 200mg Tramadol Also they prescribe here much smaller packs We got 3 script sizes N1 is 2 blisters a 10 pills blister N2 are 5x10pills blister and the biggest ones are N3 with 10x10pills blister If someone with cancer for example needs more pills cause he will die for sure then they start giving you more and stronger pills I know a guy who got cancer and he will die in the next 1 2 years from it and then the docs will make it as comfortable as possible he gets 2xN3 packs of 80mg ER Oxy and a N3 pack of 60mg IR Oxy for breakthrough pain and also he gets 6 8 x 100mcg hour Fent patches He is often very high cause he dont uses the fent patches as prescribed cause he dont like them that much he just uses them if he really is in big pain He then uses about 2 3 fent patches a month and is nodding the whole time Also he probably needs to go to a hospize to die He will go there for his last 3 6 month if he wont be able to die at home But yeah I can understand you you guys got Norcos hydros oxy etc way faster than ppl here in Europe and thats why you are so used to it Yeah I remember when they took out my wisdom teeth they took out first the right side and then 3 4 weeks later the left side cause my teets already broke theough and were way too big for my mouth So mostly here in Germany you get Ibu or metamizol Paracetamol for tooth pain I got a pack of Ibu 800mg and a pack of Paracetamol 600mg After the first night I had to go to a emergency dentist cause it was Saturday and no dentist was open and because I bleed so much I had to puke a few Times in the night and that tore apart the strings of the wound I was in extreme pain and the energency dentist gave me a script for Tilidin Naloxon 200 16mg which is the most prescribed opioid in Germany its a good opioid for pain and also if you take more of them you can get a nice buzz off of them At first my mom didnt wanted to get me the Tilidin cause opioids are soo bad and she is in general against all medications she wanted to give me Globuli and a few other shit of nature healing shit thank god that my dad still lived back then and he got me the script from the pharmacy and after 7 days my face was still swollen and I took all the Tilidin just a small pack he went to that emergency dentist again and got me a N2 pack N2 means that its a pack of 5 blisters in one blister are 10 pills at first I had a N1 pack with 2 blisters for the second wisdom surgery my dad drove me and he told the dentist to give me a script for Ibu Paracetamol and Tilidin and that he should give me a N2 pack minimum my dad could do such things very good he was polite but you knew that he wont leave untill he got what he asked for He was an awesome person miss you so much dad I still know that he took me once to his pain doctor and he told the doc that the Tilidin and morphine isnt working anymore and that he wants to get Oxy ER 60mg cause he got that after a surgery for a few weeks and it helped very much so he talked so long untill the doc gave him a script for Oxy ER 60mg and also the doc added a script for Oxy IR 40mg and also a script for 100mcg hour fent patches He got enough patches for a month if he uses two of them in a week but he just used one a week and sometimes none So after he died he left a stash of 400x200 16mg Tilidin Naloxon 200x60mg ER Oxy 150x40mg IR Oxy 60 100mcg hour fent patches 600x200mg Tramadol and 200x120mg DHC and about 50x10mg Diazepam and 80x2mg clonazepam All the amounts are a round abound If I write 400 pills it could have been 390 for example I just remember them really good cause after my dad died we got alot of benzos I especially became much more cause I found him dead and got PTSD from that also my doc already knew that I had Depression before my dad died so I got a big script for Alprazolam 1mg Lorazepam 2 5mg and diazepam 10mg So I digged through the stash in about 6 8 month also my brother took a few pills but only about max 50x200 16mg Tilidin Naloxon I brought the whole stash in my room after about 2 month and told my family that I threw them away cause 1 I couldnt see them anymore and 2 my dad and I shared our cabinet in the mirror cabinet I hope that makes sense LOL And my family believed me when I just had about 100 pills left to stay well I started meeting ppl on the streets who used mdone and I got a 40mg blister 10 pills again for 60 I then used about 80 100mg mdone daily for a month then my plug went MIA then I tried Heroin cause I wanted to try it so badly and immediatly fell in love that was about 8 10 month after my dad died The next 2 years I used daily about 1g of H 3 and for the last 6 8 month of the 2 years I also used about 8 12mg clonazepam daily in between I mixed in also meth coke crack many different benzos and many different opioid pills My favorite pill beside Oxy IR are Tapentadol currently I really like them very much I maintained myself with them for about 2 weeks and tapered down at the end of the taper I had no wds which never worked with mdone or any other pill If I could get a monthly script for enough of them then I could live a sober life for sure LOL Sorry for the wall of text but I am high as a kite Yes you can get high from bupe if you got no tolerance I would start with a very low dose like 0 5 1mg cause bupe is very strong opioid But yes if you got no tolerance like you have then you can use them recreational Because of the dose you should maybe wait for someone who knows bupe better than me I just know from this sub that you can use them to get high too Many ppl snort them also to get high IDK if the bioavailability is higher if you snort them But yeah as said maybe wait for someone else to give you better direction of dose I know that in my country theee are 0 2mg and 0 4mg for pain and many addicts use these pills to get high if they cant get dope Also there are 2mg pills and 4mg and for maintenance there are 8 2mg Bupe Naloxon like the subutex you got in the USA All the other pills got no Naloxon in them so many ppl here shoot them also Have fun dude and dont take too much Yeah from the Pregabalin I also got bad visions Its like if you use too many benzos and black out At least for me it was like that everytime Yeah I know sorry but english isnt my first language I meant by seeing a doctor that he should go to the ER and see a doctor there That was what I wanted to say But yeah I probably said it wrong But yeah that shit looks disgusting anyways and I dont get it why OP didnt came to the solution on its own that it is necessary to go to the ER If my arm would look like that I would be very concerned about it and would go to the ER immediatly Fuck if OP waits much lobger he can lose his arm That shit isnt fun I know 2 people who lost an arm and a leg The guys arm looked very similar to OPs one he waited about 5 more days and kept injecting in that arm and missed a few more times and then boom he lost consciousness and wakes up in the ambulance car while driving to the ER and they had to take the arm off because otherwise more limbs could ve been getting infected And the guy who lost his leg shot in the same spot for about 2 weeks straight untill he had a really big hole it looked a bit like in requiem for a dream and the hole got bigger and more infectedso badly that he couldnt walk anymore and his whole leg turned blue and black and stank like a 4 week old dead pet and he kept shooting in that leg cause all his veins were already gone cause a month before they already had to cut out a ca 15cm long and 3cm deep part of his leg cause of missed shots and abscesses The guy who lost his arm killed himself 3 weeks after losing his arm He hated life after losing his arm He kept using while he was in hospital and his other arm had 3 abwcesses and the doctors told him to stop IVing in that arm cause otherwise they need to take the arm off too and after that message he went outside to smoke a cig and walked in the clinic forest and shot about 2g of dope at once with a extra large syringe he had stolen in the hospital and died there They found him the next morning The dude who lost his leg went to long time rehab for 6 month and was clean for 3 years and then relapsed he is now in the mdone programm and uses dope from time to time but he is only smoking now and since we just have 3 here smoking is a good alternative to shooting dope So OP please go to the ER immediatly I wish you best of luck and that they can fix your arm fast Yeah I am not alone I am living togetheelr with my older brother he tqkes care of me He also savved my life twicw qlready when I ODed He is an awesome older brothee and I love him for that He always takes care of me whether I black out or if I OD he already aafed my kife once when I stopped breathing for 5 min and once when I lost conscious I qlready told him often that he is the best big brother on this fuvking world At leqst ai dont have the feeling anymore that I need to puke But thanks to you also for caring about me Its 3 30am here I will eat now smth and then I will go and sleep a bit LOL You are welcome I just also had to get that off my chest cause I think the amount and strength you guys got pain pills for injuries that could have easily been treated with half the strength and amount of pain pills But I also understand you if I would have been able to get pain pills in that strength for one of my many injuries like broken arm leg etc I would feel the same also because of that fact you guys are feeling pai way different I know that pain is subjective and if you had access to pain pills way easier for decades then the general subjective feeling of pain is way different than in other countries So I really can understand you Maybe you can call your doc again and tell him that you are in extreme pain and if he is able to give you a script for a weak opioid like Tramadol or norcos hydros 5mg 10mg Maybe that is working And I also wouldnt ask directly for opioids I would just tell him about your extreme pain cause if you ask for opioids then the red flag pops up in the docs brain Did you ask him directly after the surgery for pain pills or did you just waited untill he gave you a acript ,opioid^black
0,0,0,0,None,This is who people should be listening to and trusting those specifically trained to manage pain and opiates I don t claim to know all the answers but I know that causing someone additional pain is not a successful outcome Physicians can talk to each other If a dentist doesn t know how to manage a chronic pain patient call the fucking treating physician who does This is not new This is not hard I don t want to talk for others but I m not sure that people ever really feel depressed Not how the commercials say we should at least I m not sad but I ve also waited for my black screen Andrew Solomon once said the opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality Maybe you can understand my bumbling too lol I hope you figure your movie out Hi thank you for the response and concern and advice I really did not mean to make it sound so juvenile I would never think of reddit advice as gospel and I wasn t really looking for advice per se I have my whole normal set up for the weekend days off work Kratom clonidine supplements support hydration 87 lbs of dark chocolate etc etc and I have options for after and still a ton of support I m not going in blind I know many people here have kicked before and I really just wanted a conversation of opinions I ve done it a handful of times and I have attempted the taper before trying to be responsible ish and prepare And I have said forget it and did all the drugs and had all the fun until it was quit day I think there are good and bad points to both either way the withdraws still suck Idk about getting their licenses ripped away but there are so many regs now with prescription I know it is hard but keep looking for a physician that will truly work with you There are pain specific docs that can and will dose for opiate tolerant patients You may try looking for someone in palliative care it s not just for the deathbed or Physiatry A lot of Ortho will get you nothing ,opiates^black^chocolate^opiate
0,0,0,0,None,I appreciate your support and more so I am terribly sorry to hear about your dad I can t imagine how tough something like that would of been Thanks for your advice I doubt I will ever try to use opiates as a self medicating tool and there won t be any doctors in my area who think that s a good idea with good reason I think I ll stick to prescription ketamine and maybe try some shrooms Yeah I completely understand Which is why it can a bit frustrating with treatment resistant depression It s almost like there s no cure or help for people like us unless we try something a bit outlandish and frowned upon However I also don t want to develop a horrific opioid addiction because the way it makes me feel on it makes me feel like the person I always could have been and I know those signs lead to despair eventually when overused It s just tough out there man I just thought by 2020 we would be able to work out our chemistry Thanks for your comment bud ,opiates^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Tram is the most divisive opiate that exists About half of the population is able to metabolize a good of it into desmethyltramadol a good opiate while others can t So the ones who can myself included like it those who don t don t I remember reading threads on Bluelight and Erowid ppl would just rip anyone who liked tramadol as either being noobs or falling for placebo So many flame wars over tramadol lol Brought a bunch home from Mexico and my nephew who d been snorting Opana LOVED em as well The only thing I have to add unfortunately is worse case scenario all else fails If you come upon the 11th hour and still haven t found a new Dr if she gets herself admitted to the hospital somehow BEFORE the scrip expires the hospital will provide her meds 24 7 until she s discharged I know that s pretty drastic and may only buy her a few days but other than suggesting you she source the black market it s all I got Question is she affluent Could she come up with 1000 a month or more if it meant continuing to receive her meds Do they plan to taper her off COMPLETELY or lower her dose or switch to something else Older woman 30 years on meds no history of abuse about to lose it Yea this worlds gone mad Keep trying diff pain mgmt centers Daily And good luck This dude is lying through his teeth He didn t lay out his best friend with a single punch and put him to sleep for what 7 straight hours That just doesn t happen If dude was out for more than a few moments that d signify severe brain damage potentially meaning the guys going to be dead or a vegetable for life Y all need to quit gobbling up the untested mystery chemicals from China its makin ya severely gullible lol It s the interwebz not just the only place dudes this badass exist the only place they brag about their bad ASSness No it wasn t U4 Apparently it s an extremely clean VERY potent and very euphoric energetic synthetic opioid After reading about it I REALLY want to try it Apparently this guy was doing the equivalent of 500 bags of H worth I can t even imagine what those withdrawals felt like Just yikes I think the exact same thing every time I see the latest multi billion dollar settlement state X reaches with pharmaceutical company Y not that I necessarily agree we need to be rehabilitated or treated why tf isn t this money funding new rehab clinics why isn t it paying for someone s methadone or suboxone scrip rhetorical question of course Because they don t actually care about helping anyone And the average citizen isn t going to demand safe clean potent pharmaceutical heroin bc opiates are bad unlike the good drugs like weed cigarettes and alcohol We should be ashamed of ourselves for enjoying the euphoria a good opiate delivers This thread is great The post that comes to mind was my first time doing any opiate ever and its heroin kid wondered why he was vomiting Because you didn t do H you did fent he was told Begins arguing no I m sure it wasn t fentanyl if it was I d be dead plus it didn t feel like fentanyl From the kid who d never done an opiate before Yeah bruh this isn t cw it s fetty The days of scoring heroin so pharmacologically pure it s snow white are o vah Takes a REALLY good H chemist with REALLY good lab equipment precursors tons of opium gum a sophisticated criminal supply chain to transport the final product then you really gotta know people to get yer mitts on it before it gets stepped on by 150 different dirtbags Meanwhile a gram of fent costs a few pennies to make in a Chinese lab is 100x more potent than even the very best H and can be bought direct by any 15 year old with internet access and a basic understanding of Bitcoin You ve been snorting fent not H bruh Yeah benzos are already scheduled narcotics and they re starting to be treated the way opiates are despite being SUCH lifesavers for so many ppl I have acquaintances who ve been introverts their entire lives had so much social anxiety they couldn t get a girlfriend or boyfriend then they got on klonipin and it literally changed their lives I know there s a lot of people who love popping em like candy but me personally I never really got it too many just make me feel sluggish But more power to em Xannies make my job dealing with customers way easier but I m glad I weaned off W D is a bitch and one physical addiction is enough for me Nah man it s still subjective based in the individual I know that for a fact because not only did I get a fantastic high when I was opiate naive it still made me very very happy when I had a heavy oxy habit Codeine otoh just yuck Hated it and always have It is a precursor for several kick ass opioids tho I don t understand the pharmacology and don t claim to but perhaps there s non responders responders and heavy responders All I know is it works for me and it s not placebo I d take it over hydrocodone which I think sucks ass any day no question And the stuff I got from Mexico was just insane Both my best friend and nephew who had an opana habit at the time got rocked off it Wait this stuff is schedule I bro Is it legal in China as far as you know Not a dumb question imho From a lay perspective if bth is just poorly processed H perhaps further processing can be done Obviously you can t go back to steps that were rushed done improperly But bth just seems so raw I d be surprised if the opiate alkaloids couldn t be further isolated and refined Hopefully someone with chemistry knowledge will chime in Another buperenorphine precip wd misconception that even the most informed among us still have myself included until recently bupe doesn t cause wd bc of its high binding affinity reduced intrinsic activity It causes it because it s a competitive agonist plus it s low intrinsic action at the receptor If it was the binding affinity alone all kinds of opiates including methadone would cause precipitated wd in anyone addicted to a more powerful opiate like H or Fent Lol they could just as easily write a lower dose accidentally with that tactic Congrats and all but I don t think I could distract my doc into writing oxycontin instead of ibuprofen I m not gay but I m really good at coming off gay Have a light lisp and can easily and convincingly seem 100 gay And I m reasonably good looking was much better looking before I got into dope but I m still a good looking cat who also looks much younger than my age I d be better off finding a gay doctor and just flat out trying to convince him to write what I want Pretty much any opiate but bupe or codeine ,opiate^black^china^opioid^opium^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Im a big psychedelic user also Ive dropped acid and eaten mushrooms in dreams and have seemingly had full on trips I wake up super fuzzy every time ,dreams
1,1,1,1,None,So I have had a total of 3 lucid dreams but the first 2 only last about 10 to 30 seconds at most before I got too excited and woke up However the 3rd one was last night and it was the first time I was able to stay lucid for an extended period of time It felt like 20 minutes or so and I got to experience a wide range of activities before waking up I had trouble with stabilizing as well but I did the trick where I rubbed my hands together and it helped but I still kept losing stability All in all it was an amazing experience and it ended in sex lol but everytime I kept getting close to orgasm I would wake up but it was a false awakening and I kept doing a reality check and going lucid again to try to finish the job lol Care to share any of this heroin trap music of yours I m genuinely curious I ve always sought out music and songs that were specifically about heroin or opiates in general When you first mentioned heroin trap I immediately thought of this dude that I ve been listening to for a couple of years who I would describe as heroin trap rap His name is Drippin So Pretty and he has several songs about heroin addiction Off the top of my head there is Last Shot Heroin and Dope Sick There is a music video for Dope Sick and it shows his trying to hustle up some cash in the streets I believe he ends up pawning a gold watch and meets his dude at the end lol He is a legit heroin addict in real life or at least was at one point He has started to amass a cult like following and is really starting to blow up online he s got like 50k followers on Instagram and hangs out and makes music with GothBoiClique GBC aka Lil Peep s crew Anyways I d love to take a listen if you wanna post up some links or you can DM me them if you re not comfortable posting them publicly It s called sleep paralysis It s a very phenomenon that happens to non users as well Your body basically paralyzes itself so that you don t act out your dreams in real life and hallucinations hearing voices feeling like someone is standing over you or something on top of you is choking you or holding you down are all very common side effects of it This is actually where the incubus succubus folk lore came from I mean technically you are correct I just feel it s not really a lucid dream unless you become aware and can manipulate the dream What he is describing is more like a faux lucid dream because in the dream you know you re dreaming but your brain doesn t actually believe it so it s more of a story line to your dream than it is a reality if that makes sense It s almost like a passing thought rather than oh shit I m dreaming and you become self aware within the dream In the couple of lucid dreams I ve had there was no doubt I was lucid dreaming I woke up absolutely mind blown and shook from the experience Not necessarily it s possible to be aware you re dreaming without actually being lucid It sounds like he wasn t in control of his dreams either since everything happened spontaneously Bruh no offense but you have admitted you have never tried heroin or opiates before and you are trying to argue with a bunch of life long heroin addicts who literally obsess about heroin all day every day Pure heroin in the powder form China white ECP is literally non existent these days it s ALL cut with some form of Fent including but not limited to several different types of Fentalogues who carry varying types of properties ,dreams^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Do you really need to try perc 30s is it worth the risks hate to be that guy but opiates are no tip toe anyway insufflation will always hit better than oral administration because the nasal membrane is very porous and thus allows drugs to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream whereas you generally have to digest something orally administered which usually lessens the effects and increases the onset of action Plus you end up swallowing some of the drug that you snort anyway edit i assume by perc 30s you mean 30 mg oxys Percs only go up to 10mg oxy hcl 325mg acetaminophen equivalent to 9mg oxy 25mg for human is a lot if you ve never ingested marijuana and nobody describes cannabutter by the weight of the butter My brother has never taken as much as a perscription drug he took 5mg and didn t feel anything 5 8 110lbs I started on edibles after quitting for 3 months took 50 mg and felt a moderate high I ve accidentally dosed my auntie with 30mg never done drugs and it was hard to tell if she was high Furthermore the whole poisoning thing for animals is still unconfirmed Actually as recently as 2016 there were tests for dog thc treatments for anxiety disorders and seizures All of the symptoms of the poisoning are effects humans get when ingesting weed The issue is that they don t know they are ingesting a psychoactive chemical which is the risk you take with any drug you give a dog THC would be no more dangerous and probably less than whatever opiates benzo they ll give the dog at the vet There are eayy more confirmed deaths from adverse anesthesia dog perscription There was one case that reported 2 dogs died after eating thc but it has no sources and doesn t say they died from the THC There are countless videos on youtube showing the effect of a dog ingesting thc ,opiates^auntie

1,1,1,1,None,I have heard about most of these unfortunately and that is why I am trying to quit The community told me it is 100 safe and a cure for everything from depression to opiate addiction I started it to deal with depression and it worked at first I now realize how fucking dumb it was to use an opioid for depression The one thing I will say in defense of it is that in my and many other people that I know experience dangerous overdose is incredibly hard to reach I know many kratom users who are stupid about it and take multiple doses of extract while really drunk or on benzos and just end up vomiting really badly at worst Not saying that it can t cause respiratory depression it just is a lot milder than most opioids when it comes to that I know people that have overdosed off of 30mg of hydrocodone and a few drinks However Most days I wake up in cold sweats I don t want to do drugs at all but I know that I will feel better when I take it It fucking sucks I understand why it should be available to people It helps people quit hard opiates I would 100 rather have a loved one on kratom than heroin or booze From the limited medical knowledge I have from researching all of these drugs it is a partial opioid agonist mu opioid receptor kind of like buprenorphine right I have heard many people say it is like hippie suboxone because it is a natural herb that works like subs without the naloxone obviously As far as I am concerned myself as well as all of my friends are concerned about it I hate having to take it but I also need something to use to relieve stress I deal with anxiety and depression pretty bad and SSRIs have not helped Cannabis gives me anxiety and I am aware that alcohol is horrible as a crutch I know that I could go to detox and then inpatient rehab but I am in school and really don t want to take time off as this habit isn t life threatening right now at least ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Methadone has become my favorite opi recently after heroin of course for two reasons 1 Unlike suboxone I can actually get a decent buzz from it 2 It costs me barely anything compared to any other opiate If I m doing heroin or oxys I probably will have to spend about 100 200 a day but methadone only costs me about 10 30 for a full day of being high Personally most opiates are very easy on the tummy for me I rarely get nauseus or vomit on any opiate no matter what dosage so I m not sure if I m the right person to ask The only opioid I occationaly puke on 1 100 chance is subs for some reason so it is at least nicer than buprenorphine But if you are having problems with nausea and vomiting i recommend that you eat something if you feel the nausea creeping on Lying down on my back for a few minutes also helps and antihistamines also help If nothing works the best solution is to go puke and get it over with as it is a surefire way to feel like a reborn man Yeah back when I was a opiate noob I used to get a full night of nods and euphoria from just about 0 5 1 mg of subutex good times Now I just use it occasionally to keep the withdrawals away or to taper off and my dose is usually 8 mg As I don t live in the states I ve never had the strips only the pills with and without naloxe I always snort or boof them which I think has far greater bioavailability than doing the sublingually The bottle on the picture actually contains liquid methadone so it s just one dose I ve got a few more bottles in my stash I ve recently had some 40 mg capsules of methadone though from France They actually were much better than the liquid stuff I ve got now even though I m taking the exact same dose which is kinda weird since it s the same amount of the same chemical as far as I know I don t have any pics of the French capsules but I m getting some more next week or so might post a picture then Yeah that s what I mean there is a lot of drug user who do stuff like coke and ecstasy but would never try opiates If they get one of those fent pills and don t test them they will certainly die Some dealers are fucking morons why would you kill your customers how s that good for business Sounds like a killer combo tbh I would probably try it out if I had the chance My issue is that the average coke user is probably not an avid opiate user as well and without any tolerance or even not even knowing about the fent in the coke they buy sounds a recipe for disaster almost straight up murder Yeah I usually stick to just doing opiates I do benzos and stims very rarely compared to my opiate usage I just helped my dboy out with some weed and I got the benzos and amphetamine for free so I figured I might as well go all in for once My opiate tolerance is through the roof so I can handle pretty high doses with some benzos involved But thanks for the warning ,opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,this is pretty normal imo i use opiates for physical pain but also for emotional pain been on them for over ten years and there have been a countless number of times i used them instead of attempting suicide this will probably be an annoying question but do you get psychotherapy my psych has me working a sort of plan where i stabilize my doses and practice harm reduction my goal is to get off them eventually but know i cant cope without them rn i often consider methadone programs but for now i get them from a pain management specialist i really am not here to tell you to buy off the street or wait but i think there is a benefit to stabilising your dose so you can observe how you feel on a day to day basis all i know is i have cptsd and depression and they work more than my seroquel and lexapro told my doctor last week he didnt react well anyway best of luck ive been where you are still kinda am and i know its not easy Edit what frustrates me most is that smoking and drinking arent a big deal at all to doctors despite their very well documented links to cancer and organ failure but you tell a doctor pain killers help you cope you are treated like junkie scum ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,It seems almost virtually reality esque in many ways Like its purpose is to put you through reality based simulated experiences Almost like the way dreams work The immersion of Salvia definitely seems interesting to me but also daunting lol Legal drugs or psychoactive household products don t tend to be that safe So you have to weigh the medical and health side of things against the angst of procuring from the black market and decide which one you re willing to settle for False memories like confabulation Or mixing up dreams with reality DRC Because I think confabulation and dream reality confusion are distinct from each other but wow that s interesting Never knew DPH could confabulate Makes sense though I haven t quite experienced that Do dreams become conflated with waking reality like with nightshades Like I would dream I found a 100 bill and then later that morning after waking up I will reach in my pocket for the bill and then realizing that was just a dream I had Yeah from what it sounds like I m thinking it may just have this dimensional temporal feeling to it Like dreams parallel universes and reality folds ,dreams^black

1,1,1,1,None,I personally would not waste the opioid that would be lost in extraction or my time That is just me If I had an unhealthy liver took other hepatotoxic meds or planned on making this a regular treat I would do a CWE Only you know the details I am NOT recommending this but even if you took all 15 you would be over the daily max acetaminophen by only 900mg During the peak of my pill addiction there were days when I was taking 10 15 tabs of the 10 500mg Lortabs 3 4 times per day This is a ridiculous amount of acetaminophen and I am lucky me and my liver are alive and kicking today Enjoy Depends on several factors The big distinguishing point is if you have already had a cycle of use and withdrawal before If this is your first period of continuous use it can take 6 months of daily or almost daily use If you have already experienced the hell of opiate withdrawal it depends on how far you have progressed in your addiction It takes less and less time of using to experience full blown withdrawals the farther you go and the more episodes of withdrawal you experience I have been through the ringer with opiate addiction and for me anything over 1 5 to 2 days and I pay with 7 10 days of acute opioid withdrawal Hope this helps Freedom sanity dreams relationships self worth but if you buy in bulk you can get a deal Looks like a histamine reaction not a missed shot or an abscess An abscess takes days to form Histamine reaction is a common side effect of opiate use Especially IV Put some ice on it and take a Benadryl You will be fine Any opiate can stop withdrawal from any other opiate You just have to take enough if the rescue opiate is not as strong as the one you were addicted to In your case it would take about 360mg to be equal to 150mg of oxy daily Keep in mind that every body is different and like someone else said you may have to play around with the dose but should be able to get well enough to function You won t get high on codeine Good luck No it doesn t It is a full opiate agonist with average binding affinity Suboxone is a partial opiate agonist with very strong binding affinity the reasons it causes PWD Hmm You might try boofing for maximum bioavailability I wouldn t expect much from that dose The starting dose for opiate naive and for just simple pain relief is 15mg If I understood your post correctly you are coming off of subs Bupe the active partial agonist opiate has a very long half life The reason why using every 1 3 days was keeping your body in a steady state of opioid intoxication and making the detox the same as coming off of a daily use habit PAWS is real but it isn t what you are experiencing PAWS is kind of like a brain zap that occurs seemingly out of nowhere and tricks your brain and body into being in withdrawal It can be 6 months or even up to 18 after you are done with the acute withdrawal and you are hit with the yawns and cold chills or sudden diarrhea and anxiety etc it usually is very short lived and decreases in frequency as the weeks go by What you are experiencing is the long hellish detox from subs It can be 3 4 weeks of the acute phase with some lessening of symptoms about halfway through just like regular opiate withdrawal only halfway is 2 weeks instead of 2 or 3 days So no it isn t PAWS but you aren t crazy you are still detoxing Hopefully each day will get a little better than the last from here in out Congrats on your progress Keep up the good work Ha ha Yes used as a filter instead of a wheel filter for anything being injected Pills or heroin or any other shitty class of drug that isn t opiates I am not sure exactly what you mean but I am going to take a stab If you take your presses pill and cut it into quarters you have no idea the dose within each quarter Pharmaceutical pills are made with consistent active ingredient dosing This means a 50 mg pill that is cut in half will have two equal 25mg halves A pressed pill that contains 50mg active ingredients could potentially have 0mg in one held and 50mg in the other half Fent presses pills are very dangerous because of these hot spots Fent is prone to clumping and not being dispersed equally and is often compared to a chocolate chip How many chocolate chips will be in your next bite None or enough to send you to your grave Take care and be safe Just a histamine reaction Common side effect of opiates They cause mast cell de granulation which releases histamine Take some Benadryl beforehand if it really bothers you It is nothing to worry about and does not mean you are allergic to the dope Take care The fatuous attempts to catch a buzz from bupe We all try it Rarely do we succeed Maybe the opiate naive or like TAT said the first 1 2 days of taking it there might be a slight head change Either nothing happens or adverse events are encountered Nausea and headache are the two most common It should pass in 1 5 2 days Do what TAT said and I would add taking some ginger products If you have a prescription for promethazine or odansetron that would be the most helpful Hope you feel better soon Good luck on your recovery and from experience just get your mind to believe you will have zero luck at getting high on bupe it will save you frustration and more nausea Well I guess the Suboxone blocked all your opiates 7 Lortabs a day is not a huge dose by the way People legitimately taking a prescription take that much You are welcome As long as there is enough water to put the opiate into suspension it shouldn t really matter However I would go for a smaller amount of water over a large amount just because it will absorb faster and have less chance of being absorbed by the stool What size syringe are you using ,opioid^opiate^dreams^opiates^chocolate

1,3,1,1,None,Kratom helped me quit a 2 year hard drug habit Goodbye heroin pain pills and meth Hello wonderful helpful leaves When I was tapering off the opiates my doses were higher 6g 3 times daily but I was able to lower my kratom dose over time to 3 5g once daily on days when I take kratom which is now about 3 4 days a week The days I do not take kratom I feel no urge to take it it s just an optional supplement It really is a wonderful plant and has helped me more than I can properly express When I was using kratom to get off traditional opiates my usual dose was around 5 5 6g and I found it perfectly comparable to a traditional opiate high though without the intense side effects and the overall synthetic feeling I would get from taking pills or street h It s a wonderful plant and it helped me get clean I also don t wake up the next day feeling like I need kratom regardless of how much I take in a day I used to do CWE with percocet acetaminophen Was always paranoid there was still apap in the mix and was worried the damage I was doing to my liver So far as I can tell moderate kratom usage has no major health impact and it makes it a lot easier to enjoy the experience guilt free Codeine is a very weak opioid and imo kratom can deliver more of that bodily euphoria than Codeine in the correct dose with the correct strain ,opiates^opiate^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Honesty is not always the best policy Specifically in relation to this topic I told my therapist just yesterday I refuse to be honest about my opiate struggles because if I m ever in pain in the future I want proper treatment I refuse to be treated like some piece of shit drug seeker when I m in actual discomfort and all she could say was that actually makes a lot of sense I had a for instance of course So it wasn t just a what if scenario I ve experienced the way they treat people who are on suboxone And magically since I ve been off it I ve been treated like a human being again Because apparently that information isn t readily available to every doctor you see Specifically when you make a big deal about it and tell them Im no longer on that medication and I want it removed from my records We are still people are we still have the right to proper medical treatment Fuck anybody that tries to make a person feel bad for a drug addiction Especially considering it was the piece of shit doctors that started this whole epidemic because they re greedy fucks There is nothing else on the planet that feels like hydromorphone Which is why it s so deadly and addictive I personally get a lot from the right strains of weed But it s nothing like being high on opiates What a crazy ass drug I d be lying if the description of it didn t intrigue me I would love to have an opioid that gave me that kind of energy But at the same time I ll happily stay away As long as I live I m never gonna get dope sick or benzo sick again I get almost nothing from kratom Maybe I ve yet to try the right strain or whatever But I currently have no opiate tolerance been sober for a little over a year Friend gave me some the other day for giving him a ride home for court I figured wth I m bored and I haven t slept Took it in hot water at his house By the time I got back to my place my mood was elevated and I had more energy But this was short lived Kratom just doesn t do it for me Haha well that s a whole different discussion And it s impossible to police every kid that uses the DNM to purchase fent Part of the problem is corruption and our history of funding covert operations with drug money China and mexican drug cartels are long helping But it s definitely America a bullshit war on drugs that is primarily causing this problem All of our heroin is cut with fentanyl So there would be no way to police just fentanyl in America The U K is just different man and I m glad you guys took care of that problem your way But it would never work in the states that way even if the police were actually trying to do the right thing ,opiate^opiates^opioid^china
1,1,1,1,None,Personally after having runs with both I can say heroin is more addictive than meth by far even though I truly enjoyed both There is absolutely nothing like heroin it s one of those drugs that everyone says stay away from but when you first try it out it just feels like your regular opiate just a little better imo Then its an on and off thing that s not that big of a deal until your doing it everyday Months go by and now it cost more than you d care to admit just to stay well and when I say you re gonna change I mean it fucked up shit doesn t seem as fucked up as it use to as long as your getting your fix Then you get tired of spending all your money to just be okay and then you face a choice a needle or quit And then it happens again I recently picked up the needle and I can say that I don t even want to quit I do but something about a good shot of dope just outweighs most of the bullshit that comes with this life and it s not a life you want to live Heroin addiction is sneaky and will get you and once you get got your trapped Be careful out there if you need someone to talk to I m here I thought it was cap too honestly I was on and off of opiates including heroin for years but this last run is the one that got me ,opiate^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,It s so hard because of this bull opioid crisis I m also 27 many doctors don t believe me It s a hunt to find a good doc I recommend seeing at least 2 3 specialists for conditions Also make sure to get the official RA diagnosis that ll help keep you from getting dropped I ve had FAI and now have back problems and Degenerative disc disease I m 27 I go to college now it s bloody hell and hard I use a crutch to get around They have a shuttle thank god to get around campus If you re not doing anything it definitely makes you look like a drug seeker Not saying you are but you absolutely need to find some way to make it look like you re a productive member of society Maybe try online classes or some type of job where you can work from home Either that or disability Without disability no job school is a red flag I wish you the best of luck it s not easy I ve had a L5 S1 disc bulge with nerve root impingement for 5 years now There s no way I can do yoga I don t have much ROM Inversion table helps somewhat been using it for a few months 1st epidural is scheduled for Thursday I ve been doing Physical therapy for 6 months Just had an MRI and the bulge is still the same size I tried chiropractic care a whopping 600 month from the top rated guy locally on yelp No improvement I go to pain management where science comes in the form of a pill to battle my pain for me I am eternally grateful Life would be very hard to live without this medicine Now I don t know of pain management criminals or businesses really I do know of some sympathetic doctors who spend years in training applying themselves deep into medical debt giving their 20 s to care for pain patients When there are several other lucrative specialty practices And they re now overburdened by this fake opioid crisis where ignorant ppl say all doctors who are prescribing opioids are criminals and that this medicine is an illicit drug Easily accessible research via google can show that most opioid deaths are the result of illegally tampered opioids with Fentanyl from China or Mexico not pharmaceutical opioids The truth is opioids are the only pain medications that scientifically act on the actual pain receptors themselves on a chemical level So you actually should probably not go to pain management Because these doctors just want to get you hooked on opioids which have a smaller addiction rate than alcohol Pain is just pain and all pain patients should suffer So when your bulge undeniably gets worse like mine has and looks to be permanent now you would be a full on sociopathic drug seeker to even ask for pain medicine So many patients are suffering from physical conditions that don t go away but ofcourse we should all suffer because an opioid is an illicit drug and drugs are bad m kayy It doesn t matter that science has medicine that can relieve pain you should forever stick to Tylenol even though Tylenol doesn t even come close to chemically relieving pain as opioids on a chemical level And you should be thrown in jail if you ask for pain meds or if a doctor prescribes medicine for pain then jail is a must They re just trying to get pain patients hooked even though these opioids can very well safely be tapered over 1 2 months All pain patients should suffer and all pain doctors should be locked up for having the ludicrous idea to use science to relieve pain Am I right or am I right My dad and brother have recovered from substance abuse problems I have another brother who s addicted to narcotics x200B I ve been prescribed opiates for surgeries on and off since 2014 I could of asked for refills several times but didn t I recently started pain management a year ago bc the pain got much worse It seems that you re aware of it all so you should be good If you research opioid addiction rates they re similar to alcohol So it s not like you ll forsure get addicted Just monitor and be honest with yourself and you should be totally fine like many responsible chronic pain patients out there That s why we should vote Andrew Yang in he intends to legalize opiates like in Europe Once it s legal ppl will be more accepting of it Although there s still plenty of ppl who won t legalization will things easier The problem is I don t know anyone else who s into opiates He knows he s the only way in the opiates crowd I have no fucking clue who else to ask This dude was with the only H crowd in high school There s not too many ppl who I can ask I ve known this dude Heavy nods way slurred speech like long and dragged out when you re on H constant stomach problems can t eat spicy foods Yes I m fucking entitled because I m FUCKING DISABLED AT AGE 27 And I m a close friend I believe that makes me entitled in this particular situation I m going to be in a goddam wheel chair soon I can barely walk it s so obvious the motherfucking pain I go through And a close friend can t even help me out Does H completely drain your soul He can ask his dealer or plenty other ppl who does H He literally said sorry nope didn t even try He knows plenty of ppl who may know someone He can be like I ll ask around Betch your ass I m entitled god motherfucking dammit Nah man through all we ve been through in life I m literally going to be in a wheelchair within the next decade We used to be best friends man And I do still see him time to

doesn t even try Not at all It d be one thing if we were just acquaintenances but we ve known each other most of our lives being best friends at one point He s not obliged but he can at least try to tell me to hit up someone we may know Socal opioid pain pills works on pain receptors Seriously though I ve been limping literally all throughout my 20 s and he tells me to just deal with the pain You and I know he has some hooks Bitch ass punk needs what he deserves Lol They re pieces of sh that s why they asked I m going to switch I wonder if there s a wait when filling a first opioid script at a

1,1,1,1,None,What I ve always done and it helps probably 70 of the time is dip Smokeless tobacco It s a vaso constrictor like garlic which works too so putting a huge dip right on the gumline in front of the tooth stings like hell for a bit but reduces the swelling like hell and so makes the pain bearable I put it on and leave it on An hour later or more I ll replace it I m a nicotine addict so I have a good tolerance for it If you don t have a tolerance then it like most poisons will probably just make you sick but yeah I still have a can in the car somewhere from the last time I had a tooth that made me want to murder people in the moonlight Edit Garlic works too Chopped up finely and put on the gum but it s harder to maintain as it gets everywhere and it burns worse than dip It does reduce swelling though It s all about reducing swelling Ibuprofen is a MUST Combined with tobacco or something like it should have the pain manageable within a day or so ,gum

1,1,1,1,None,You re a lucky man if 30mg does anything to you at all I m currently consuming about 600mg 1g once a week although I ve cut down on my regular usage to about 300mg a day I was using about 300 450mg once again up to 600mg pretty often although I have a huge tolerance and never really got noticeable effects from it I don t understand why I still consume it if it doesn t really do anything for me On the other hand I wouldn t be too worried about consuming smaller amounts of chocolate as a delicacy as your mind would probably play the placebo affect on you before you actually received significant amounts of any chemical to give you psychoactive effects at least with how it seems you re thought process is and how worried you seem I bet you it will be more placebo than anything I highly doubt chocolate has enough caffeine to trigger psychoactive effects in somebody who has been addicted for 25 years I d guessimate it s about 5 30mg max You d have to consume large amounts of chocolate to get any noticeable amount of stimulants from it Don t get me wrong i ve read some absolute nonsense on this subreddit before but what you just said is sometimes what I think about not including infinite other theories i thought about but I also think that s part of the key is realizing that potentially all these infinite possibilities exist for yourself and your own universe but you have to master your ego for it to come true But it doesn t play out the way you think it will you have to truly and ultimately chase your deepest fantasy although it plays out oddly I think I understand why most single objects in the universe are spherical based upon gravity like planets and stars for example is because no matter what way it s observed there s always a point directly on the other side of the sphere to the first point but inside the sphere there is infinite degrees of direction you can travel to reach the second point This to me simply implies that life itself as you live it has infinite degrees of direction and birth is the first point and death is the second point both points are like a negative a opposite and have a some kind of five dimensional geometrical graphing of some sort to pinpoint wherever around the outside of the sphere Mastering the ego completely which most humans are not consciously aware of is where you can achieve full movement inside your own universe although you can t break scientific law and you can t ever seem to escape the moment eventually Feeling like that makes time come to a halt as you reevaluate everything that ever was is and will be a infinite times over You just can never seem to find the final key that unlocks the longest path to the second point you MIGHT even have the option to never reach it if you don t want to which would mean achieving some kind of immortality but I believe that would trigger something inside the sphere or just simply wouldn t be allowed by whatever law governs it that is yet to be discovered This also implies because everything relatively is spherical in shape the bigger and smaller we get that the universe is a never ending sphere of some sorts I feel like If everything is a never ending sphere it just means everything is reused and recycled into another form all throughout time this meaning our pure consciousness as well But once you are fully conscious and have mastered your ego you will realize there is no point because you are the point this whole time ONLY to forget why you became the point You exist at this point until you realize that everything is indeed infinite and while you will never find the last key as those are infinite too there are infinite paths to take only bound to the scientific laws we re aware of also bound by things we are unaware of which I think birth death and potentially DMT shows us all dreams and fantasies of which are theoretically possible if a malicious group doesn t kill you off once you gather too many keys kind of like a real life RPG with bosses and shit but where your stats are like ego luck etc DMT gives you the answer to who what where when how about yourself but you will never figure out the why which is infinity Now because everything inside the sphere can be mapped not only three dimensionally but fourth dimensionally by time the outside of the sphere that brief glimpse of our conscience reaching that point of finally getting a peak of what s on the otherside that very brief moment between death and your new life you realize you are the sphere only to have your conscience recycled into another living being because remember we live and die continuously inside this sphere therefore we are aware of the dimension of time as well as volume width and height or 3 dimensional space It gives rise to a notion that we ARE governed by a creator of some sorts which exists multiple dimensions above what we can perceive as humans and is effectively what we call infinity The real twist in this is that once you realize that you are the sphere you realize that any dream you could possibly want could come true but so can your nightmares I m a firm believer in mastering the ego which in theory should allow you to walk your path desired as long as you obey the rules Predictable situations still have predictable outcomes you can t play God or try to by any number of infinite ways God has the first key the last key and all the keys in between as he placed them there for you on your quest but remember there are infinite keys So while you can keep collecting keys you will never find the last one or the why Infinity is nothing but a infinite ladder of up or down as we choose to climb or descend You can go as fast as you d like in either direction and I believe DMT to have shown me that I believe DMT creates such a certain chemical ripple in our brains that turns off or blocks out all sensory information from the five senses if you take a high enough dose to achieve a breakthrough experience doing so causing us to rely on our only perception of existence left our absolute raw conscience the point that self realizes it s the entire sphere Complete loss of ego Eventually most realize we will never have the answers to that which has been purposely placed out of reach but just remember after all my rambling nonsense when you are shown the doors after collecting enough keys the right thing to do is still knock first afterall it was never your sphere to begin with Well one Hersheys Dark Chocolate bar has about 25mg of caffeine in it so I suppose it just depends on the type of chocolate more specifically I would do your research on the caffeine and other stimulant content and potentially consume chocolate with minimal contents of stimulants My best bet if the negative side effects of caffeine consumption even in low amounts that you experience are enticing you to correct them with a benzo I would just avoid caffeine at all costs then That seems the most logical step Again you try to figure out how to avoid effects of caffeine through enzyme inhibition but that seems like a challenging task but best of luck ,chocolate^dreams

0,0,0,0,None,I mean he did say MLK was murdered because he was fighting for economic justice and explicitly said it wasn t for civil rights this past October with Killer Mike too a black man This is what I ve been saying Obama faced similar obstacles What always amazes me is my very old now dead uncle was super super liberal Like always voted for the left but he wouldn t vote Obama because he was black You leave the race thing out and he d look like he was a super educated old man The thing is and maybe I just notice this because I m a white gay man I see a lot more people who I have what I d call weak homophobia where they re like Oh I m fine with it as long as they re not waving it in my faces read as long as they don t fall into any stereotypes and the only way I d know is because of who they re dating Still awful but politically that bodes well for Pete because that means I think he could get some homophobes votes Hell he almost got this one That disc was the shit I remember the day preorders started I had my mom rush me to the toys r us 45 minutes to preorder I got that disc and got Jirachi the moment I got home I was so excited to finally have an event pokemon I read a comment that explained well why this would actually be a bad idea If we shut out travel to and from China people would just fly somewhere else and enter or leave This happens with some banned countries I think people used to do that with Cuba fly out of the U S then fly to Cuba North Korea gives tours that visitors can read must take when visiting There s no flights from the U S to North Korea but they get American tourists from people here flying to another country then flying to North Korea I think their tourism site even explains how to do this People would still enter China and leave to come to the U S Banning flights would just make it harder to track who all might have been exposed so it s better to just let it happen to keep better track and not have to check multiple flights The only way this could work is if the entire world agreed Every country would have to agree to ban travel in and out of China and China would have to agree too I m sure China s borders are well guarded but that s why they have to agree to protect that We d effectively have globally agree to quarantine the whole of China China is pretty self sufficient but they do rely on some imports We d also have to band together to send supplies there which would require some entry but very controlled entry That s not even to mention what would happen if you just quarantined 1 billion people What would happen Would China be able to run close to normal Would their be a mass panic What would happen to all the tourists non citizens there currently How does Hong Kong function in this which I could right a whole post about how they could leverage this Or Taiwan Would the whole country be under martial law What with the military do to people trying to escape Will they cut the internet off completely limit information both inside and out TL DR Cutting off international travel just to the U S would just make things harder The only way to make such a tactic work is if the world effectively quarantined China which would have a lot of problems Only thing I can think of is quarantine anyone who s come into contact with someone who s come into contact with someone who is infected The problem is that s a lot of people that alone would be hard Not to mention you quarantine that many people it d be impossible to effectively limit airflow between all those people in this short of time So you get someone who isn t infected they re not showing symptoms after 2 weeks however they re stuck in this building with 200 other people for 2 weeks and one of them is sick You let the uninfected go well because they were in such proximity of someone who was infected for 2 whole weeks they re much more likely to be infected now 2 weeks later they show symptoms and now they re going to infect even more people because they were quarantined earlier What China is actually saying is closing off cities like they did is the only effective way to limit the spread which we can t do So China s doing one of two things here 1 Best case scenario Flexing to show that their plan is the best This could be either to defend quarantining the cities or it could just be them doing their usual Hey guys we re the best and want you to know we re the best 2 Worst case scenario They truly believe the only way to do it is to quarantine cities that are infected and are trying to warn us so we can do it earlier than they did Either way we can t really quarantine a city here It hurts China when they do but it s a different government and culture ,black^toys^china

1,1,1,1,None,When I was 15 my parents went to Italy for 3 weeks My older brother was staying over to watch me but he knew I d be fine by myself so he went to a friends up the street for the night I got bored and wanted to get high or drunk I had already dabbled a good amount in the fine art of Mary Jane My parents locked up the booze cause they expected my brother to have a party or something I went to my parents room to see if my parents had anything interesting like Benadryl dxm or whatever would make me tired Yep I wanted to get tired and sleep I was that bored Opened a drawer and found a plethora of pill bottles Looked through em mainly just antibiotics But there were another 2 bottles One of those two bottles had 19 5 300 hydrocodone The other 4 10 mg diazepam I took 8 of the hydrocodone and started googling if they were any good I soon realized I had stuck gold Snorted 4 of em took 2 Heaven Yea ik it was dumb to snort the hydros lmfao But god damn I was so mind numbingly calm I felt like my freshman crush had just hugged me I spent that night playing xbox and listening to peep till 7 am I have no idea how I didn t pass out Knowing 15 year old me I probably had a few energy drinks Tried beating off cause ya know 15 year old home alone and high why the fuck wouldn t I To no avail Other activities of that night consisted of a 45 minute hot shower an entire season of bojack horseman and FaceTimeing the girl I would literally move to fucking canada for if she didn t feel guilty for cheating on her boyfriend with me and un adding me on snap So yea that s the first time I tried opiates High on hydros rn as I type this I miss that fucking girl so much dude I fucking miss her From the sound of it you probably have no tolerance 1950 mg of acetaminophen is just about half of the max daily dose so you re good there 30 would probably be a bit much for someone who s opioid naive If I were you I d take 3 4 depending on your weight and take the other 2 later in the night until you hit a good spot Well on it s own it s pretty much just good for knocking yourself out Makes you tired af But it s also good por potentiating opiates ,opiates^opioid

0,0,0,0,None,I d say more that it is the efforts to come to orgasm like foretaste of it high dopamine Later upon release la petite mort huge endorphin rush is released with the feeling of emptiness Like the cycle high dopamine triggers foretaste of pleasure endorphin release ejaculation high prolactin low testosterone so called apathy numbness after orgasm repeat So technically all this addiction is a blend of stimulant low motivation apathy etc and opioid troubles with sleep for instance resemble the opioid withdrawal addictions And I know what am I talking about because I was in those addictions And yeah the title is correct entirely You know apart from caffeine there are lots of drugs that weakens REM cycle Alcohol other psychostimulants for instance I remember when I used amphetamines I rarely had even dreams With caffeine the same thing Hypnotics also tend to help with going to sleep though the quality of sleep still not the best Also problems with sleep can be additionally caused by lack of serotonin because melatonin is made from serotonin I assume caffeine is only a part of the problem hypothetically And it can mess with serotonin levels also You know ideally it may seem that quitting all drugs can return person to feel normal Caffeine can also maintain that PSTD status quo like overthinking and overliving the same cycles We can even suppose that OCD can be also caused by unending stress and lack of sleep Some even state that OCD can be an issue caused by lack of serotonin x200B I think the other question is what REM phase is needed for I mean in the stance of PSTD nightmares Like solving that riddle in the form of dis ease via REM sleep phase My friend who works in psychotherapy once said that his colleagues and teachers saw how people patients overcame their issues just with sleep And you know what s interesting That today s world work almost without any sleep 24 7 Is it some kind of coincidence rhetorically speaking Here also I remember Decartes quote about the pineal gland that it is the seat of the soul Pineal is linked to producing of melatonin Like interesting chain is here lack of sleep low lack of melatonin low serotonin soul pineal gland PSTD OCD nightmares caffeine REM cycle It can be that a person is drowned in his dis ease purposefully And you know I sometimes struggle with anxiety and sometimes it detaches myself from what I have to do This anxiety can inhibit growth like continue some vicious cycle of doing the same things experiencing the same emotional states living again the same traumatic events that were in the past and logically now don t serve any purpose at all The past is no longer here it was somewhere far away and it can t be changed Like being in the present living the past cycles I don t know how to describe it other way Though the only way it can be checked is to try to live caffeine free If ill effects go away the riddle will be solved That s why decaf Haven t seen movie so don t know You know from my experiences I can assuredly say that the best heroin use is on stimulants comedowns It is even better than benzo don t burn me I m not heretic lol Overdose is an intense feeling fucked up like weak ties with reality falling into unconscious I once went with my mom to bank and I was extremely high on it And she saw me smashed on the seat waiting for her She was horrified about seeing me smashed Though heroin is the best physical high apart from sex From opioids as for me the most interesting is tramadol I like it because of serotonergic activity I once was too high on it and wanted to go to sleep laid on the couch and found out like those dreams were extremely vivid though I wasn t sleeping Like to dream without dreaming In retrospective I can say that tramadol is the best opioid as for me because it is unique in some sense Don t know maybe there are something new ones that were invented Speaking about psychedelics I think after all those binges on stimulants opioids even weed psychedelics are the next logical step like maturiation in some sense Another level of pleasure and entertainment I think everything has its place I assume it can be possible Substance or any other abuse is connected with some kind of a problem In my stance caffeine only enhanced my fears though it made me possible to see them I think it s a tricky line between what a person really needs and abuse For instance alcohol abuse can have some problem inside in the person who drinks alcohol I used to drink alcohol just for getting rid of tension in me and soothing me And you know I drank alcohol with people that had nothing with me and I thought they were friends though we only drank alcohol like brothers in distress Sometimes substance abuse is a mask of some problem Sometimes it is some kind of easiness of a problem like in opioid addicts About traumas I can say that trauma has meaning in the lives of people Without them there is no learning Even birth of a baby is a traumatic event Sometimes other people with even harsh traumas can make others feel bad Though understanding that others can suffer more gives some temporal relief I m not speaking about developing Stockholm syndrome no As for me even harsh events in life have some meaning to learn something and probably share with others I assume also overcoming some traumas and doing the other way with a person s children is a key to success Like you ve seen how children should not be treated now you can show how it should be done with knowing how it doesn t work I believe people should do impossible things because without impossibilities there would be no miracles Yeah thanks for your reply man I just want to understand what I ve done wrong that really isn t working to go further With caffeine yeah like I m coming to conclusion that there is no need in it If caffeine the thing that holds me back And it is quite possible because fight or flight response which is a prolonged b body wants to maintain homeostasis due to wish to get rid of anxiety that s why relapse can be an option because it is an opioid relief So probably the stress was a main factor I assume Though it amazes me how caffeine can intensify all the inner problems fears tendencies etc etc You know from some perspective caffeine just shows the weak points of a person especially fears Though I m not entirely sure about the fact whether these problems already were in the person or just it is some kind of a delusion caused by caffeine You know I ve made kombucha using coffee instead of black tea and it seems like it doesn t give me the same jitters as a cup of coffee I haven t digged too deep but some sources state that during brewing of kombucha caffeine content decreases I m not sure entirely though I said in my other posts that porn and masturbation were just a coping mechanism with my stress feeling lonely traumas and some partial parents neglect Porn just was a temporary pill that doesn t work anymore Like an opioid medication that couldn t give anymore pain relief I agree with all the things you ve said absolutely Nofap is just a way of life with later creating new healthy habits in order to understand what am I who am I what I like etc etc A hero s journey thing That s why keeping diary and writing down everything a person feels experiences changes he she can see is a step towards maturing Nofap is like some kind of psychotherapy with some introspection Like you were in hell now find your way through purgatory to Eden metaphorically speaking Good luck you too

1,1,1,1,None,I remember my first experience clear as day I was just a quiet JR in HS A friend came up to me in class and told me to take a tylenol and I thought nothing of it thought maybe he was just being random so I took it since I knew ZERO about drugs He comes up to me at the end of class and asks if I feel anything and confused I said no so he gives me another 2 and I take them since one of his boys is now telling me that this tylenol will relax me I went a whole other class and a half without feeling anything I had already forgot about it at this point but then it all hits at once I got warm and soooo happy it was unexplainable My eyes felt so soothing I had this smooth type of energy and this strong confidence came over me I was in english class and just wanted to read to the whole class because i felt so sharp I had detention after school and it was the greatest hour of silence ive ever experienced Everything in life just felt so right and made sense I wasnt this awkward kid anymore and it lasted til I went to sleep Hours of non stop euphoria and i couldnt stop talking I was talking to strangers at the grocery store and on the street It was the most perfect feeling in the world It was vicodin that he gave me btw I was sick throwing up for hours and hell it even felt great to throw up 10 years later and im still dabbling with opiates with 4 years of combined breaks in between of course and have never had a serious problem because my fear of god and anxiety has always kept me from going over board Ive tried every opiate provided by pharma except oxymorphone Ive tried everything from tramadol to fentanyl patches once but surprisingly hydrocodone is still my DOC I have never tried H and never plan to do so and I dont say that in a judgy way im just terrified from everything ive learned on r opiates So many details to this story but tried to keep it short So im assuming before you tried H your tolerance to opiates was through the roof already right Was the first H high the same as the one from that first yellow in high school I heard some where the only time you get that first high feeling is the the first time you try any opiate and the first time you try H ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,kratom seems to be good for withdrawals based on what i ve heard from people who use have used it The only thing and it is a big thing is Kratom becomes addicting and dependent itself and when you get off kratom you re going to have the same withdrawals you would ve had from Kratom dependency as you would from Opiates Just because Kratom is legal doesn t mean it s completely safe and not addicting and dependence forming that s funny you say that because I just brought the dab rig back out today forgot I had it stored away and as soon as I wake up tomorrow I m gonna try to cop some wax and see if that s any better for me nowadays than weed God I hope so i miss enjoying weed dearly Honestly think if i still enjoyed weed I could get off of opiates no problem but I won t let myself drink on weekdays and I just need some way to not be sober and weed just isn t an option anymore Let s hope some low doses of wax can get me right if you decide to DEFINITELY wait til those effects have worn off first Fuck mixing benzos and opiates in my opinion ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,How do you dose 25 micrograms Volumetric The dose is oral Also I find a bit irresponsible advising to someone with no opiates tolerance carfentanyl finally 25 of carfentanyl would be like 100 of fentanyl U 51754 exists but it is rumored to be more a dissociative than a proper opiate A guy on a forum compared it to xylazine but this is mere pillow talk I am also eager to try U44770 from what I read I would love it I am just concerned about its caustic properties which appear intrinsic 3 HO pcp is great but I heard is almost impossible to hole on pcp analogues However PCE is closer to MXE so it might be possible Again the HO residue is suspected to have a mtor agonist action so probably it is already granted a mix of effects between a disso and an opioid Using bucinnazine other name for the compound you used might have tapered off the dissociative effects of 3 HO PCP I suggest you to try the compounds alone however I myself never holed on 3 HO PCP albeit I have a couple of experiences only so it can be more expert users have ,opiates^opiate^opioid

0,0,0,0,None,A couple of things one since you mentioned benzos and passing from my understanding benzos clear your system super fast so it s not too difficult to get those through and out of your system I ve also read before that a few benzos including lorazepam can sometimes be undetectable period That may have changed though that s just what I read from a few different sources at some point in the past So they re not a great reference to go by Secondly do you know what type of test you re taking That can make a HUGE difference in what s detectable There are standard UDTs the cheapest and most basic which will only verify what is in your system and will only indicate the presence of certain drugs and these types of test have a higher cutoff rate as to how much of the drug is in your system to result in being positive That test type is different than the other types of urine screening like a mass spectometry test This test type has a much lower cutoff amount as far as looking to see what is in your system So whereas a standard UDT may only test positive for say oxycodone when a level of 50 is present a mass spectometry test may test positive if a level of 30 or above is present These are just numbers for illustration I don t actually know the actual levels used for oxycodone for the two Does that make sense though That each test has different levels that make presence of a certain drug a positive or not Basically a mass spectometry test is MUCH more sensitive than a standard urine screen and will make you test positive for something that you may not test positive for on a standard UDT Not only that but a mass spectometry test does more than just verify that a drug is present it actually can show roughly how much you ve taken and when by measuring the active metabolites to the inactive metabolites The other thing to note is that the cutoff levels for any type of drug is different so never base your estimated detection time off of another drug particularly when they re in different classes For example as I mentioned above benzos generally clear the system way faster than opiates do Our bodies also eliminate drugs in different ways For example my understanding is that an amphetamine like Adderall actually leaves the body through urine and isn t stored in fat whereas marijuana gets stored in body fat and therefore stays in the body longer You really need to know what type of drug test you re taking to figure out your detection time If it s an old fashioned cheaper urine drug test that is just checking for the presence of s drug and thus has a lower threshold as far as metabolites hanging around that will result in a positive then 3 4 days for oxycodone is what I ve seen as the detection time However from what I ve been looking at and been told it s more like 5 to 7 days for a mass spectometry test to show the presence of oxycodone because that test type is wayyyy more sensitive I d recommend drinking a TON of water from now to whenever your test is Just remember to take some Vitamin B I believe that s the vitamin to take for this too and do so especially right before the rest so that your urine doesn t look too clear and therefore cause them to think you re trying to dilute your urine for some reason as the vitamin apparently will darken your urine to a normal yellow even though you ve been drinking tons of water And don t forget that when calculating your half lives that the clock is basically started at the time of your last dose so you ll want to go by your last dose regardless of how much smaller or bigger it s been compared to ones right before it Because if you test positive for it it s going to also show the active to inactive metabolites the inactive metabolites being indicators of doses you ve taken that are older and stoll hanging around vs active metabolites which will indicate the more recent doses you ve taken Let me know how it goes Would be interested in hearing your results especially if it s a mass spectometry test Out of curiosity how much oxycodone did you take at your last dose and when is your drug test from that point For example was your last dose taken on a Friday at noon how much did you take then and is your drug test the next Wednesday Hope this helps I ve been looking into this myself a lot lately because I also have a drug test coming up a little over a week from now and have been trying to find out about oxycodone and mass spectometry tests and also of taking a drug regularly effects detection level This is all based off of my recent research so there are likely some terminology mistakes in this and its missing some suoer exact info and maybe worded terribly but Im trting to simplify it and just sharing what my understanding of it is Im confident someone else can explain it all better but I hope it helps or points you in the right direction of where to further research ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,I live in the United States in Ohio I assume if I can buy it from a shop here that there are other shops like it in the United States as well Kratom is a plant that is supposed to have opioid like effects Opioid lite almost It s currently legal in the United States except for a couple of states I think France banned it I m not sure where you live so results may vary For me it was easily accessible both from a location standpoint and price It was 10 for an oz I just walked into a shop and bought it with cash I believe head shops also sell it but I hear bad things about the kratom that s sold there for some reason You can also buy it from the internet that s the most recommended approach I believe In my opinion since it s legal where I live the effects are somewhat worth it if I can find the sweet spot and no other cons show up from reasonable usage If the effects mellow out just a bit and I don t experience too much nasuea I think the effects would be quite pleasant and or a really nice sleep aid Based on my current experience I can definitely see why this is used for opioid addicts to help with withdrawal symptoms wean off opiates I ve never used opiates so maybe someone with opiate experience would feel differently or feel the effects were rather weak If it was illegal I don t think it d be worth the potential trouble unless you re looking to wean off stronger opiates It s certainly nice but it s not risking jail time or losing a job nice But everyone is different I ve tried other drugs here and there but I haven t fell in love with any of them so to speak Your mileage may vary If you re interested in Kratom and end up buying it don t start at 3g I would say start at 1g Use a scale and don t eyeball it If you don t feel anything wait a couple days and up the dosage by 5g Rinse and repeat until you feel something I personally wouldn t go past 4g because if you go above a certain threshold with Kratom either by overdosing or by trying to take more to prolong a good feeling you will just get sick instead Sweats shakes nausea etc Everybody is different maybe some people need 8gs of it to get an effect but I feel like it s not worth it at that point I also wouldn t re dose in the same day You can re dose but it s better to play it safe It s super important that you don t take it everday Kratom has shitty withdrawal symptoms too similar to opioids but less severe You don t want to deal with it There have been small reports of liver toxicity and kratom As in some people s livers might not be able to break down kratom properly I ve only seen these reports from people who take it every day and the symptoms seem to stop after abstaining I haven t seen any reported fatalities in that regard but it s something to be aware of in any case Oh also it tastes super bitter It s not pleasant I personally didn t understand the big fuss about the taste I definitely wasn t about to puke like some reports Kratom doesn t dissolve well in water but I find it dissolves quite nicely in some homemade almond milk Apparently people have had issues with kratom clumping and sticking to their mouths when they ve used store bought almond milk so you might want to watch out for that https www youtube com watch v l9 TrCUTg 0 https www youtube com watch v l9 TrCUTg 0 https www youtube com watch v HedEeSDzNSY https www youtube com watch v HedEeSDzNSY This guy has 2 informative videos on the subject ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,I actually recall hearing that something like only 10 20 percent if not significantly less than that number of people who do meth are addicted and do it irresponsibly and with great detriment to their life The guy is a professor at John Hopkins I think he did a ted talk and was on Joe rogans podcast a black guy with long dreads He studied drug addiction and specifically methamphetamine and his findings really challenge the common consensus on hard drugs don t quote me on the statistics but yeah most drug users are not addicted My guess is when we consider the consequences of meth and heroin we only look at the toothless homeless junkies and not the business man or mother who is using and is in control With stims redosing does work but leads to way worse comedowns as the second dose generally masks the negative effects of the first dose starting to set in by the time you need to dose again By the time the second dose wears off you ll have been clenching your jaw and tensing your muscles for a good 16 hours straight with no food and improper hydration That s how people manage to stay up with no sleep for 5 days on meth and in some cases seem fine until they crash It catches up with you soon enough always but you can mask the comedown with enough powder God what awful memories Opiods are the best drug in the sense of redosing as long as you have enough Because they replace your brains endorphin and act in the same way you do not experience the diminishing effect of amps where there is no dopamine left in your brain for it to release with opiates you will be able to achieve the same effects Everytime with the right dose Tolerance does build however and once you build it your dose will not decrease for a while The worse drugs to redose are probably psychedelics in that they pretty much do nothing after the first dose in any 2 day timeframe Marijuana is actually most enjoyable spacing it out too but redosing will never fail to get you higher Benzos are easily redosable same sorta deal as the opiates but dependency is pure evil Yeah it s weird At one point it seemed to get me quite stoned My pupils would be pins and I felt all warm and fuzzy But mostly it doesn t seem to do anything I would bet it would help relieve some of the withdrawal from opiates This is why people shouldn t even try those kinds of drugs once Opiates and amphetamines both can and probably will trigger something in a person s brain that just can t be turned off and that overpowers a person s rational mind If your predisposed to addiction and there s no real way of knowing if you are or not until it s too late then you will get hooked even trying these drugs once or twice ,black^opiates

of the WDs it took away about 70 75 of the WD feelings Opana seems like it would be even worse as it s literally the most potent pharmaceutical form of oxycodone on the market besides Laudnum but I ve never met anyone before whose even tried it Years ago I had a huge addiction to 10mg Percocet 7 5mg Endocet and 4 75mg Percodan with the odd Nucynta 100mg and Darvocet N 100 thrown in I was using 70 120mg of Oxycodone tons of APAP no idea how my liver still works every other day or every day when I could I had a very close friend with a 10mg Percocet script and lived with my best friend whose Grandma is an opiate addict and had HUGE scripts of Soma 350mg she literally got fuckin 500 of those a month Percocet 10mg 325mg APAP 5mg 325mg APAP Norco 10mg 325mg APAP OxyContin 10mg Darvocet N 100 100mg propoxyphene napsylate 650 mg APAP such a weird drug and others I m forgetting The withdrawal from just the oxycodone and APAP was SO bad that s actually when I started using harder opiates like OxyContin 80mg Roxicet 40mg so that I didn t feel the WD from just plain old low dose oxycodone apap If you don t mind me asking how did you get Opana The dealer I knew that sold it had fatal AIDS Do you have chronic pain Second question have you tried any form of Darvocet and if so do you remember it enjoy the high I used to like those better than Codeine but that 650mg APAP was a literal killer and i either got high or felt nothing I always wanted to try Darvon which is Proproxyphene Hydrochloride in 65mg and 100mg dose capsules and NO APAP The hydroxhloride version is stronger than the napsylate version and I ve heard they were awesome from my Grandparents who used to know people that slammed it drug abuse runs strong in our family but luckily none of us got hooked on the needle I m super curious about your answers to my questions hit me back when you can Thanks and much love brother Thank you for listening it means alot to me thank you I went through a big opiate phase in my late teens early 20s and Opana Oxymorphone was the holy Grail back then I preferred it over 80mg OxyContins one 40mg ER Opana would have me GOING man What was the WD like from Opana I wouldn t want to go through that sounds painful as all hell The Oxy ordeal is what got me hooked on fucking Suboxone of course I m not an MD but I m definitely an extremely qualified street pharmacist the Nurses PDR which lists every prescription drug on the market each pills dosing side effects brand names what schedule it s in for instance all Barbiturates are C II except for Fioricet which has 50mg Butalbital per tablet and is a C III and oddly enough Phenobarbital is a C IV like Benzodiazepines basically everything a doctor would know about RX compounds and meds It was my Bible I read it everyday to the point that I have it basically memorized Klonopin brand name for Clonazepam has up to a 60 hour half life long half life I think only Valium and Librium are longer 90 protein binding meaning it binds extremely well physically 90 BA which is extremely high BA bioavailability so how much gets in your bloodstream and its effect or high lasts 6 12 hours It s one of if not the most potent benzodiazepine available in the US All of this sounds scary but Clonazepam is one of the most reliable and safe benzos an example of an unsafe benzo is Halcion Triazolam It s got a 6 hour half life works orally after about 5 minutes and can cause hallucinations and obliteration for those without benzo experience tolerance and has tons of side effects like forgetting where you are or who your mom is lol You are on a low and safe dose 5 or 1mg is low and appropriate as opposed to the idiot who gave me 6mg Klonopin day and 400mg Phenobarbital daily What you need to remember is that Klonopin builds up in your system this is a good and a bad thing It s good because like you said if you run out you won t feel sick until day 4 or 5 BUT this is only if you take it on a regular basis Since you ve been on it for a year or years and take it semi frequently your in a good position where you have a tiny theraputic amount in your system Based of what your telling me I know you wouldn t seize out and I bet the worst of it would be heightened anxiety maybe insomnia and some panic attacks I have a suggestion that will answer your question Stop taking your Klonopin asap and see how long it takes before you feel ill If you re lucky you may have very mild WDs or possibly not have any symptoms at all as I mentioned above This means you aren t hardcore physically addicted meaning you can continue using it as needed and won t need to worry about seizures or having withdrawals However to be honest Klonopin binds so tightly to your GABA B think about that protein binding I talked about above and the strong 90 bioavailability that I honestly think you d need to taper slowly at home or spend a short amount of time probably 6 days to 1 5 weeks depending on how you handle WDs in an inpatient detox if you wanted completely off However i AM 100 sure that you could easily get completely off of it if you wanted to without a huge hassle I think you could do it at home by titrating your regular dose slowly to zero It would look like this taking your normal 5 or 1mg daily start as low as you can comfortably 2 days of normal doses then cut a 1 4 off the 1mg pill and continue with that lowered dose for 2 3 more days and then cut a 1 4 of the pill again etc etc until you re taking a 1 4 of a 5mg Klonopin for as long as you need to be comfortable and then just stop Personally I d do an inpatient detox bc they re like a vacation you just chill on a unit while they detox you You attend AA NA and watch tons of TV and sometimes make some really good friends Or even better have casual sex Im happily engaged and have been for 6 months now and wouldn t change it for anything but when I was single I smashed at every detox rehab and sober living I went too it s easier when your gay lol Bottom line you re at a low risk and could easily titrate off over 2 weeks at home if you have will power and you seem like you do Sorry my phone died before I could edit this You hit the nail on the head man Tekken is too intense now imo especially with the constant de ranking in fact imo the ranking system in T7 is absolute shit the blue ranks are HELL until you re out of them No one likes to be demoted and since everyone is everyone is pissy most of the time besides the Gods of Tekken like Lil Majin Victim of Ritual Knee etc You re also 100 correct about the emotion part as well Even though it s cringy as hell I have an emotional attachment to Nina as a character I actually did martial arts because of how cool her throws and moves were and now have a black belt 1st Dan in Hapkido did it 11 years every other day and am well versed in Aikido I also identify with her personality which I don t want to get into plus she looks like a young Michelle Pfeiffer I think Michelle Pfeiffer is the hottest woman alive and actually have an outfit hair based on Pfeiffer s character in Scarface lol and is truly lethal in the right hands Nina has always been more challenging to master than most other characters from her chain throws in Tekken 1 to her insane difficulty in Tekken 7 though they did tone her difficulty from extreme as fuck down to really hard in S3 no more x5 iWS1 combos constantly which gives me a sense of pride that I know how to use her effectively which I think is true of most serious Nina players Most Nina mains I know are like me in their 30s I m 31 and have been maining her since the original Tekken I literally play no one but Nina until I ve mastered her in that particular game and then I ll start maining others Jun and Michelle in T1 T2 Anna Xiayou Julia and Jin in T3 Anna in TTT Steve and Lee in T4 Lee again in T5 Feng in T6 and Negan and Kazuya in T7 Basically what I m saying is my main focus is always on Nina and serious Nina mains grew with her throughout the series I take Tekken too seriously and have since online play began That s some solid advice and I m gonna take it Thank you bro ,opiate^black
0,0,0,0,None,Breathe deeply have a break in the fresh air chew a gum or suck on a hard candy whenever you feel the urge to light up a cigarette If you eventually give up and you smoke one after that just think did I really need that Do I feel better after inhaling this shit Do I really need cigarettes to go back to baseline I know it s hard to quit but you must focus on negative aspects of smoking because that s no positive ones Stay strong my brother ,gum
1,1,1,1,None,I know that morphine dosages are somewhere between 10 50 mg but since this si morphine sulfate I suppose it s somewhat different If your calculations are true when I was IVing 100 mg and one time also as high as 150 mg that would be equal as 133 mg oxycodone which is insane and I would be dead I was nodding and pretty shitfaced from 40mg IV and that was when I had a H habit I d really want to know how and why are sulfate doses so higher but can t find the info anywhere Here where I m from these 200 mg capsules are the only ones they have in the opioid replacement therapy and if they would be giving them to anyone who comes for the treatment something would go wrong quickly This is why I am convinced 200 mg od sulfate 200 mg standard morphine Could you link me to those charts you mentioned ,opioid
1,1,1,1,None,I am not claiming this for anyone else but for me MAT is the worst of both worlds I m not getting high not enjoying it but at the same time I am a slave to it I have to take it every day I have to suffer the subtle side effects that no one talks about hormonal changes brain chemistry etc I don t know what motivated you to come and show us the light but if you spent more than 5 minutes on this sub you would see that probably at least 20 of the posts deal with how to handle withdrawal It s not like there is a scarcity of information here So yes at this point I am wondering why there is a big push for MAT coming out of nowhere looking like a college term paper In my view this entire subject is a justification for what is basically a crime to begin with It s like ok you guys can have your alcohol and your pot but opiates are highly illegal still and we are going to continue to make your lives miserable by restricting opiate use in every possible way And people keep dying while the pharmaceutical companies and doctors keep making money Please don t talk to me about harm reduction on one hand while the government keeps locking people up with the other It s a really bad joke That is really interesting For some reason the first thing to go when I start getting high is my desire to play music I am already one of the world s worst musicians but opiates take away my musical balance Some people say drugs make them more creative but I have never found this to be true The only thing they make me is sleepy The one good thing about cold turkey is you know that you are getting through it as fast as possible When you take any other opiate you may or may not prolong the wd There is no way to know without testing it I went cold turkey from a long term heroin habit and it did take several weeks but eventually you will feel better There are tons of posts listing all the comfort meds you can get that can help you like benzos and clonidine But arrange it now because you will probably not be able to do much once you start Amazing It is so easy to forget about all those things that happened to you or that you made happen But when you see them in black and white it is overwhelming The flair labels this as a story but it sounds right on to me I admire your ability to write something like this I don t think I could I look forward to the day someone finally understands addiction I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters My mom my dad my siblings were all insane overachievers who have the house with the white picket fence I have nothing but admiration for my parents The other family members Let s just say I didn t make their lives easy We have no history of addiction in the family as far back as we can trace it into Germany and Russia One sister enjoys a glass of wine from time to time My other sister has migraines but she takes her meds as prescribed I went to the best school my parents could find I never suffered any sort of abuse Everybody liked me at school even though I could be a jerk at times I always got invited to parties people wanted me to hang out etc We all went to college became professionals Money was never an issue I had a number of jobs over the years and loved most of them On the outside I never had any problems until I started getting busted for cashing in fake percocet scripts But I had that rigged so I never did any prison time On the inside no matter how good things seemed I always felt like there was a hole When I was exposed to opiates it seemed to fill that hole for the first time You guys have heard all that before So how do I end up a hardcore iv heroin addict How do I try to compare my life with that of Dark Btrfly I can t There is no comparison It makes no sense This is an interesting topic and it would be great if there were actual research At 2 5 mg per day you really should not feel any withdrawal symptoms Yet there are plenty of people that have said they experienced wd even at very low levels One of the better posts I have seen was from a guy suggesting that you form a liquid solution for ultra low doses Like dissolving 10 mg of oxy in 10cc of water to make your taper accurate Because realistically with the half life of oxy at 4 6 hours it is questionable whether the dose actually does anything Idk Eventually you would reach the point where you would effectively have zero opiates in your system But we don t know what happens with extremely low levels Maybe some people have to have zero levels of outside opiates to begin recovering their own natural opiate production Some people say that tapering just prolongs the whole process and they have to go cold turkey in the end Other people say that tapering works really well There are too many unknowns to be able to say for sure But I do think switching to kratom would be a good idea if you can be disciplined with your dosage There is no induction with methadone It is more like a longer acting opiate It takes a day or two to build up in your system but that s it Some people say it makes them foggy and has other side effects I was on it years ago but have never touched it since then ,opiate^opiates^black
1,1,1,1,None,It s amazing until it s hell I had this same idea in mind I wish I could leave the opiates alone and just go back to having depression because the lows I experience now are so much lower than I thought was possible I see death as the only escape that will leave me at peace and not in constant turmoil Just my 2 centz This this thiss thanks for saying this I m just now figuring out that opiates have and will lead me to more misery if I just keep using them expecting something different to happen It s funny how you start to hate something you once loved so much After a certain amount of years the hate seems to outweigh the love at times but the love for opiates is still so strong at least for me For ppl who are opiate naive it s very strong U could ve probably only took 1mg and still got high for 12 hours I m on sub maintenance trying to quit shooting heroin and it doesn t really get me high at all but helps a lot w cravings for ppl who need it it s a great tool but is also a cost effective way to get high for others which I m honestly all about just know that after about a week of taking it all the recreational effects will go away and then the wd does suck I have never been on methadone so I have no comparison but Now that I ve been on them for a couple months they really don t get rid of my I need opiates in my veins now anymore They helped a ton at the beginning but at this point I am just taking them to stave off the physical symptoms The only time I feel genuine relief from fiendish thoughts is if I stop the subs for a couple days then go back on them and for the first day it s alright but the next day is more of the same Honestly I just want to ween off them so I can do shoot some dope Codeine is just badly metabized into morphine Cut out the middle man and do some morphine with Benadryl and it s the same fucking feeling Lean really is one of the lowest tier opiates it s not worth home brewing lol You right I m working on getting clean from opiates Mostly just reminiscing about how fucking good they felt Nothing else can compare That just goes to show how strong bupe is Yeah 2 mg would probably be way too much for someone with no opiate experience I m glad there s a cheaper opiate out there that s not gonna be laced with fent I ve found that taking it every other day gives it much more of an oomph but u have to go to every other day without it which suck but I ve found this way to actually give me good relief when I do take it I also tend to feel more of an opiate felling after a vigorous workout Thanks for the response I m guessing that drug X could be a pgp inhibitor like piperine in black pepper or omeprazole maybe I guess I m going to have to do some trials of my own I know that when I have taken loperamide for opioid withdrawals that omeprazole and black pepper helped it to work which leads me to believe the same could be done for bupe possibly You can still toss the crushed shit on the foil just fine and smoke it I d recommend staying away from opiates after this because relying on them really is hell and quitting them is even worse ,opiates^opiate^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,Yeah i know alot of smokers as i am also one myself but the issue is as im not in the city anymore just a smaller coastal town none of the people i know that use recreational drugs have any experience with opiates letalone have any idea where to find them but i will keep searching slowly but surely fingers crossed i find them ,opiates
0,1,1,1,None,Huh I used to have weird and vivid dreams when sleeping high now sadly not as much dreams Btw I just got my braces on couple days ago my teeth hurt a lot now I want to light up even more but I gotta wait gotta need to be patient Hold in there mate after 2 weeks feeling of lighting up will fade away btw I seem to can not capture my display for some reason its black screen and doesnt show anything I tried display capture window capture game capture for minecraft it did not work its just black screen ,dreams^black
1,1,1,1,None,I think a lot of my dreams come from my fear of dying in my sleep My mind maybe be running to much before bed I need to get over that because I know I don t take that much but never knew if it was possible to die even on small amounts Just stupid fears that come with my high anxiety personality tbh Mine are so vivid I get like reality and dreams mixed up I hate it haha ,dreams
1,1,1,1,None,I went to a rehab called Black Bear Lodge my roommate was coming off that dude was having seizures daily looked horrible They were loading him up with phenobarbital Be careful detoxing off that dude seriously I remember having some years ago its drawl up damm near black Shit got me high tho DEFINETLYYYY just smoke bud if that helps I dont wish opiate addiction on anyone I struggle with it deeply ,black^opiate
0,0,0,0,None,Probably because you have a decent tolerance take triple your dose you ll feel the effects foresure or you might just black out lmao ,black
0,1,1,1,None,I have no advice but i am extremely jealous you re able to have that as your opiate of choice ,opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Interesting thanks I thought it didn t matter the opiate or strength they just didn t cause retrograde amnesia like benzos but fent definitely does Yeh I 100 percen t get what you re saying but I know for a fact it can t be benzos in ir because I ve taken daily benzo for ten years and can fans 15 mfg or Xanax and feel nothing and not black out for a second so my tolerance fonbenzosnallows me to know it isn t benzo involved Anything else No idea what vinyls be nnn I t besides thay ,opiate^black
0,0,0,0,None,It has cross tolerance with Valium and if the 15mg Valium dosage you mentioned is accurate an equivalent dose of Xanax would be 1mg I d say to start there and wait about 30 minutes to see how you feel If you can handle the taste dissolving it under your tongue will make it kick in even faster not sure if you re still having panic attacks but if so I d use this route of administration Xanax is also a muscle relaxer which should help give you some relief too Hope that does the trick but if not and you have more access you can take another 25mgs just don t go over 2mgs total cause you might black out ,black
1,1,1,1,None,Thats surprising to hear I myself am I heavy opiate user but like all opiate users except for yourself apparently lol I looooove me some benzos Every ope dope I ve ever met or used with has had a love for benzos as well Yeah not very many people realize the spectrum of opiate users Most are people like me with prescriptions to oxy or something along those lines that ended up having to turn to the street when this so called epidemic hit and all the doctors got afraid of the dea coming to send them to jail for trying to give their patients a better life Most people dont realize how intensely chronic pain can fuck up your life Even if that isnt the case only a small number of opiate addicts are the people going around robbing everyone and using dirty needles they find laying by the dumpster outside of the local hospital Most opiate addicts are very intelligent individuals leading very normal lives and just prefer the warm hug of an oxy rather than drinking that box of wine or 6 pack of beer inside damn near every American fridge Don t mix the diazepam or temazepam with that It will slow breathing down incredibly I have asthma myself and can tell you for sure that if you don t have a high enough tolerance to opiates and mix valium with that you will either need a breathing treatment or you will od Kpins and xans take the same amount of time to breakdown and release the drug and the feeling would hit you at the same time However kpins have a longer half life so the narcotic effect would last longer but it would be pretty fucking hard to distinguish whether you were feeling alprazolam or clonazepam Impossible to distinguish if already in an opiate and benzo stupor imo Most definitely man She would have died had I not done it The fucked up part about addiction is that even though I knew it had to be done I tried every other way I could think of before resorting to pharmaceuticals not because that s what you should do in any case of any medical situation but because I didn t want to ruin her high and make it to where she wouldnt be able to feel the drugs for the next few days Thats extremely sad and it hurts to admit it but that is the grip hard opiates and addiction have on a person The best feeling I ever had was 10 Watson blues 5mg of kpins and about 6 shots of whiskey This would kill regular opiate and benzos naive people though and even sone with tolerance My tolerance comes from the fact that my very first experience with opiates was with 80mg oxy nasally Very very quickly I graduated to intravenous use with my friends dad who was a Dr that stole meds was also prescribed oxy and also shot heroin with me All of this at 16 years old I have never truly quit and I ll be 29 this year I do truly need the pain medication now for multiple problems but with my rolerance so damn high oxy and dilaudid cant touch me Even injecting 4 of heroin doesnt make me even get itchy forget tryin to nod You d be correct but if you re already an opiate addict it s somewhat nice Saves a little money each month but with my tolerance it only lasts a few days if I m trying to get high instead of just maintaining Saving her wpuld be getting her clean but I appreciate the sentiment She was already addicted when we met I would never give an opiate naive person their first dose knowing what I know about opiates now That s the equivalent of stabbing a man in every area of his body missing all vital organs and then having the girl stab him in the heart Bad analogy but I think you get it Here is what you really need to think about Are you always going to be on some form of opiate for the rest of your life or not If you are going to be the methadone will be far superior to the oxy I m prescribed 105 of the 30 s every month but I was prescribed 100mg daily of methadone for quite some time Methadone is more euphoric in my opinion and as for the pain problems methadone like you experienced has a much longer half life meaning it will keep your pain away a lot longer than oxy at any dose The real problem is the withdrawals Withdrawals from methadone can last up to a month where as oxy lasts for around 7 days I would try to figure out how much methadone he would put you on If it isn t at least 50mg a day it probably isnt worth it but then again youre only getting 30 a day with the oxy Maybe ask if you can try the methadone for a month and if it doesnt work for you switch back to oxy the next monthvor possibly take methadone as your main medication but get a few oxy a month for breakthrough pain ,opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,How would 20mg oxymorphone compare to 60mg oxycodone an equivalent dose Are they pretty much the same high I hear a lot of people say oxymorphone is the best opiate high there is Can you provide details to the differences I m very curious and doubt I ll ever get my hands on oxymorphone I don t get benzos w opiates they always make me sleepier and I can t appreciate the euphoria as much Maybe I m just getting the balance wrong what s a good ratio for oxy snorted and valium with not much tolerance to either Ok sure I ll just swallow Never done it before but I m experienced with opiates and benzos what kind of dose do you think I should try I ve heard redosing half way through doesn t work well with them so it s best to take all at the start Shall I take one 300mg pill or 2 600mg Should I also try to have an empty stomach or does it not really matter Sadly I don t But yh I hear people say it s better than actual heroin Would love to see a tier list based on how nice opiates feel rather than based on how strong they are ,opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Well when I say beginning it still feels very new to me I feel like I was fucked up and doing opiates everyday just yesterday I don t feel the physical WD anymore but the mental part lingers I don t think it s PAWS I m just still learning how to live a normal life again I haven t been normal my entire adult life It s just a learning process I guess It also takes time to build meaningful relationships again to entertain me All my friends were drug related and I obviously can t associate with them anymore you know You ll get there It DOES get better There will be lingering issues for awhile but I can assure you that I m THANKFUL AF that I m better than the initial stages No If it helps you then keep taking it Weed won t ruin your life Personally I was addicted to opiates for many years and I ve taken an array of different things to either help with WD or just recreationally I still consider myself sober because I don t have a current addiction problem with anything I take I think sobriety can mean whatever you want it to mean for you and your life Not to mention you have a legit medical reason to be taking CBD I think about this a lot I m 4 months sober and for at least the first month I wondered is this PAWS anytime I would feel down or anxious If I sit and think about why I m feeling the way I m feeling I can is usually come to a reason why I m feeling the way I m feeling other than it just being post withdraw I know PAWS is a real thing but I think a lot of people mistake their regular feelings coming back for the syndrome You ve wasted or fucked up your life to varying degrees while you were using It will take a little bit to fix your finances relationships jobs and not to mention your hormones You re still really early on if you think you re still having emotional hormonal issues go see a therapist or psychologist for someone to talk to at the very least who has no bias It seems silly but I ve been to a few sessions not even regularly and I do feel relieved afterwards Life gets better the longer you stay off opiates Yes it gets boring and even I still haven t found necessarily an appropriate coping mechanism yet but I will And you will too Keep pushing through I ve only ever taken pee tests for preemployment and I would do them the same day and still come up clean because oxys don t fall under the two specific opiates they test for Salvia tests I m not sure about but I know that oxys aren t detectable after about 48 72 hours You ll be good Day 124 here off opiates It DOES get better I CT d it off subs that I d been trying to taper from big mistake because I didn t do it properly obviously and ultimately just delayed the hell for 24 days I will say that the no sleeping part really had me at my breaking point there towards the end because it was barely improving for the first 2 3 weeks I was just about to go get prescribed Ambien from the doctor and several people on here told me it gets better sleep wise at day 21 I thought ok yeah bullshit No one is that precise Sure as shit the night of day 21 so almost day 22 I slept like 5 or 6 hours rather than 1 3 hours of very light sleep It slowly started to improve even more after that It s amazing how a lot of your symptoms will go away or at least lessen significantly once you start getting decent sleep Other than that I would give yourself one more week to start feeling 80 normal but still probably sleeping like shit You re past the worst of it keep going Personally I would go see a specialist if you don t improve in 2 3 weeks I m at 123 days sober from oxys and while weird to talk about for me lol my bowel movements didn t seem normal until maybe around 100 days It wasn t exactly diarrhea but not that solid either I don t have pain associated with it though except for the initial WD stage I had the same kind of pain you re describing when I WAS on opiates It felt like rocks were stuck in my intensives and just kept building up If the CT scan cane back normal that s a good sign but I don t think you should still be having pain though Thanksgiving has been awhile back by now ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,If you buy pressed pills they are more likely to actually contain mdma rather than other amphetamines or stuff like benzofurans or cathinones than ever before No one is putting fentanyl into coke or xanax on purpose What happens is people are cutting heroin or pressing fake percs oxycontin pills with fentanyl and then using the same table or pill press to make fake xans or other pills and that s where the contamination occurs Real xanax doesn t feel like opiates and obviously coke and opiates have completely different effects it s a common misconception that people are purposely adding fentanyl to drugs other than opiates Also it s alot easier to find pure mdma in powder form than ever before as well ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,Lmao Chinese imperialism That s nothing compared to 100 years of conflicts literally everywhere in the world China hasn t been to war in decades while we haven t had more than 6 years of peace since the birth of the nation Why would we car about nations revolting against capitalism unless it was directly in our interest to control them I dont understand what s hard to understand about it Countries opposing US global hegemony is not the same as having global espionage How do we deal with the fact that because white people the majority of people in the US that revolutions with a base of PoC are going to be smaller than the largely reactionary white lumpenproletariat and petite bourgeois class I think we need to be able to appeal to the most exploited whites as well but unfortunately a lot of movements like the black Panthers are misrepresented to white workers as the Black KKK and as a group they have no place in I think we need to find a way to actually engage with the racism inherent in American society and engage the majority of the proletariat Ah yes hong kongs freedom to high rates of homelessness and renting literal cages So much better than China They are in favor of destroying private property though that cant happen as long as you like trade with western nations I m not sure where you ve gotten this concept of destroying private life from but people still personally have their homes and belongings China has always been a very different culture from the west and it s just hard to grasp from our point of view fuck China is a similar size to the US and has 5x the population Lol china has 30 percent renewable energy infrastructure The us is around 13 and the Us military is still the largest polluter on earth by far ,china^black

1,1,1,1,None,NTA Although using derogatory slurs towards black people is much worse in my opinion I still believe that your boyfriend is being a straight up jerk and is acting like you don t have any feelings towards his insults We re all human and just because you re white doesn t give him the right to hurt your feelings If it s really hurting you I would have a serious talk with him because it s not fair for him to expect to just take it whenever he feels like insulting you You re human too and sometimes words can hurt especially when he starts insulting your family Meth crack heroin and hard opiates like dilaudid or opana is what you should avoid The rest you listed cool in moderation Coke is also ok in moderation if you do it socially And ketamine is fun to do while taking MDMA Make sure what your getting has been tested and from reliable sources Don t share straws or dollar bills with other people if anything is going up your nose Have fun and be safe I m so sorry this life is cruel When my son Halo passed away from SIDS in September I would have dreams where I would be doing normal everyday stuff with him like breastfeeding changing his diapers and giving him baths Waking up to those dreams in full blown tears knowing life just ripped it all away from my arms I m crying while typing this I hope you heal through this Hugs I hear ya Oxy makes me more happy Dillies sometimes make me cranky but my plug doesn t have any oxys or china rn ,black^opiates^dreams^china

1,1,1,1,None,Opiates like codeine aren t very sedating in my experience so I m very functional aka have superpowers Adderall or Vyvanse type of prescription drugs are pretty fictional in my opinion Benzos NOT at zombie like doses are very functional imo to Don t do meth That s because tramadol is a shitty ass opiate Hardly an opiate and more of an SSRI I d just give up on those and try something stronger Ask your doc What to mix MDMA Acid 2 CB Acid Shrooms Acid Ketamine Acid I ve heard of opiates being cool but I don t really know about that one No meth please 750 mg of TCH is a huge amount especially with no tolerance The Xanax will keep the anxiety down but even at that dose I don t honestly know You d most likely just black out and fall asleep I d do 50mg TCH and the Xanax but that s just me Xanax acts fast and strong but doesn t last long Start off with 5mg and see how you feel If you suffer from anxiety or depression you ll feel it a lot more then someone who doesn t First time I tried benzos I didn t think much of them but then I tried them again and wow Honestly one of my favorite drugs but I m careful with them Or at least I think I am Don t mix with opiates or alcohol Weed potentates it if you smoke Amitriptyline is not a benzodiazepines but rather a tricyclic antidepressant It s one of the first gen anti depressants and has less side effects then common SSRI and MAOI antidepressants or at least that s what I ve heard Withdrawal from amitriptyline is not nearly as bad as a benzodiazepine or opiate withdrawal If you want to mitigate the withdrawal as much as possible tapering down would be a good choice Any withdrawal symptoms should not be that harsh especially if you taper down Good luck If you deal with any anxiety there a god send even at small doses If you re a pretty calm person it ll just make you more relaxed depending on the type you take Most that ll happen is you ll take enough to forget a week that you ve been benzed out and black out Least that can happen is you get the best sleep you ve ever gotten Hope this helps Buy a Fent test kit There so inexpensive but can save you re life Fent pressed pills are very dangerous and in my opinion are just never worth it Fentanyl is one of the strongest opiates on the market and it is very easy to overdose on any Fent presses simply due to the fact we don t know how much is in the pill itself and It being such a potent opiate A Fentanyl high is much more euphoric and has more of a body high then you ll ever get from a Benzo in my experience If the pill is Fent presses you ll get extremely high off that one bar and could start to nod Pretty much you ll know you took Fent due to the intensity of the high Take a quater if you can t wait to play it safe do not recommend or order a test kit Hope this helps MDMA or 2CB both mixed with weed are pretty awesome I d put acid down but sometimes the anxiety overcomes me and ruins if not diminishes the euphoria I ve never really found opiates like hydrocodone and oxy to be very euphoric by themselves but there s still really enjoyable That s just me ,opiates^opiate^black
1,1,1,1,None,Lyrica and Gabapentin especially when combined with benzos are awesome for pain I ve never taken them for pain but they definitely feel VERY similar to an opiate especially when mixed with benzos Only differences from an opiate is that you ll get the munchies and you won t itch I black out when I smoke on kpins honestly Like my friends say I act normal and everything but I have ABSOLUTELY no recollection of the night It bugs me out lmaooo I just took 6mg to help me sleep Fuck No In all seriousness I don t notice a difference in my dreams other than I can usually remember them better for a few hours after waking up Never have had crazy dreams like this in all of my life but on melatonin I definitely can recall things easier Also I ve literally never had a nightmare in all my 20 years of living Is that normal I felt pretty drunk and I kept nodding Not similar to opiate nods but I would find myself staring into space Everything kinda started vibrating too I could drive though and I was super talkative It felt like MDMA I kept having to take deep breaths because my whole body felt so good Like I was getting a full massage I definitely feel like I could up the dose I was just wondering if 750mg was a dangerous dose of lyrica ,opiate^black^dreams
1,1,1,1,None,I ve taken 130 mgs many times with no issue but I don t combine it s benzos only and 1 benzo at a time No weed alch opiates or anything Benzos alone are actually very hard to OD on it s when you mix them with other stuff then you re in rough waters ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,I was thinking of coming up of a plan of rotating between drug cycles so I wont become dependant to one For example one month I ll use benzos once or twice a week the next month will be opiates once or twice a week next month phenibut nootroopic ect What do you think of this Sounds smart and risky at the same time ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Yeah its just you know when i redose phenibut which i do rarely on the same day I often get some wierd side effects the following days after i dont think my body can handle it much But it was an important day However the first 1 day after i dont feel much but at the 3 4 day mark i get paralyzed whenever i sleep and i have super vivid dreams and a very heavy feeling in my head However i now take some vitamins and magnesium that helps removing that feeling x200B Just still a bit worried it could have any effects to the operation or if im just too paranoid Thanks for the answer bro anyways ,dreams
1,1,1,1,None,not sure who you seem to be getting into arguments with but most everyone i ve met on here is really chill and understanding that s half the reason i come to this sub is because it s the one place i m able to talk to people and actually don t feel judged almost all of us have done fucked up and regretful things that come with being an opiate users you shouldn t let them get to you man just disregard their comments and keep it moving just like most things in life there is always going to be a few bad apples i m sure i can speak for the majority and say that we re here for you and aren t ones to judge just keep your head up man the lot of us are very understanding hope you have a good day bropiate i m on day 8 right now pretty much past the physical WD symptoms as well can t really sleep well at night but like you every time i do sleep i have dreams about grabbing or snorting some 30s and then wake up super bummed the urges to use again aren t that bad until night time when i m trying to go to sleep but i can think about is damn if i had some 30s right now i could knock right out unfortunately or fortunately for me i ve been broke and don t have money to grab even if i wanted to hopefully this shit gets easier but man i don t know how people do it i ve had a little bit of weed to hold me over but i m at the point i need something to fill the void i ve drank maybe 4 5 times in the last 2 years but the past 2 days i ve been drinking just to not go insane hope you can keep up the clean streak homie keep your head up and stay strong i fuck w your name btw fent 30s were my go to these last 7 8 months lol not that many honestly way more of an opiate guy myself one of my buddies i used to get high with would occasionally have xanax and would snort them so naturally that s what i was doing as well ,opiate^dreams

1,1,1,1,None,1 I would highly recommend buying a scale to do this but in the case where you refuse to do so 2 Evenly split up your stash If you have 1g for example split it in 2 so you have 2 approximately 5g piles Then break one of them down into 2 25 piles Then break one of those into two 125 g piles One of those piles should be a good dose or even slightly less you should aim for 100 mg This is the best way to estimate without a scale in my experience I bought capsules off of amazon and filled them myself but you can also just toss those crystals in the back of your throat and wash it down with water tastes god awful so be prepared For the roll itself have gum for the gurning jaw cleaning and teeth grinding Stay hydrated Love the world happy roll Have gum And vicks to clear up all your sinuses and enhance the roll I always love mint vapes as well The most important thing is HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AROUND YOU sharing a roll with good people is the best magic no lie ,gum

1,1,1,1,None,Before opiates listening to music was my favourite thing to do Now it s listening to music while high For something with such a dirty reputation the feeling that an opiate provides is sooo pure and blissful Opiates provide to humans everything one could seek for the a limited period of time And there s no comedown 2 months ago My mom had tooth surgery and received some 5mg Percs but didn t take them cuz she doesn t like opiates I think I heard those can get you high so I steal a couple I make my first post on this sub everyone tells me They re amazing but don t do them I think They can t be THAT good so I take 10mg and kind of expect to be disappointed tbh But that first high man it was fucking incredible I never expected it to feel THAT good I didn t even know it was possible I spent my entire afternoon and evening basking in so much fuzzy euphoria I was overwhelmed It was perfection Man if my best friend found this account and knew I did opiates he would be so disappointed Hell even if it was just weed he d probably judge me Let alone opiates If you ve taken opioid medications for more than two weeks you may need to stop using these medications as soon as possible to prevent serious consequences Common signs that it s time to get off opioids include serious side effects reduced pain relief from the same dose of medications over time tolerance or behaviors that raise concerns about misuse abuse or addiction Don t try to go cold turkey on your own Opioid withdrawal can be dangerous and symptoms can be severe When it s time for you to stop taking opioids ask for your doctor s help to develop a medication withdrawal plan called a taper that gradually reduces the amount of medication you take Depending on the type and dose of the drug you ve been taking and how long you ve been taking the drug it may take weeks or even months to gradually and safely reduce your dose and get off your opioid medication Seems pretty clear to me I mean if opiates didn t exist abstaining from them would be a much easier choice to make lmao So I d probably remove them from existence The worst part is that he knows I have 3 reddit accounts and always asks me why do you need a third account lol and I m like if you only knew I like to think that if he found out I d stop to preserve our friendship But god the opiate high is so blissful I m not sure how long I d be able to abstain It s so weird how to me how humans are so predictable I ve read so many stories about how people ruin their lives due to opiates and yet I still want to take them shit s powerful man There must be a way to genetically modify humans not to build tolerance The opiate use could be endless ,opiates^opiate^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Better quit while you re ahead Take a week off dont get more valium is fine but dont let it change your mind Valium is probably worse of an addiction than opiates tho Other opioids have other metabolites as well as producing a lot of morphine I m allergic to codeine but I can do any other opioid morphine and heroin I ll die if I take enough codeine Now which one of you have dealt with real strong opiate withdrawal I ve dealt with opiate and benzo wd at the same time many times I went to rehab for it after many years of trying to control it and quit Kratom wd is there and its shitty but morphine wd is quite a lot worse kratom wd has limits kinda with opiates it feel like death I use to snort anything now I really dont like it especially when I snorted black tar vinegar bs lol that bth straight fucks your sinuses up I got a weak meningitis virus from it but it still was such a terrible illness I missed work for it n got hydros from my doc for it when I just needed a doctors note lol I ll snort some roxys or high quality 4 heroin but no coke I dont care for it anyway but my nose gets fucked up too easy now a days and I sometimes get sick a few days after from it Plus my buddy almost died and had to have 2 or 3 brain surgeries to remove infected tissue from his brain theres just so much bad with snorting you can even tell when someone has been snorting stuff by how inflamed their face and nose are sometimes that s pressure in your face which isnt healthy For the most part They can make me a little moody but I try not to feed into that opiates are the one thing I can do and can completely hide it if I want and I do from many Something I ve always said was that heroin has a lot of character Morphine morphine morphine Deff for sure sounds like it was an opiate Opiates make me and some others I know very talkative Yea I use to love it the times I had opiates and coke sure were good but I have 0 recollection other than packing a bowl of crack with heroin on top of my bud and ripping it from the bong lol A headache the same hour as railing 15mg of oxy That fuckin sucks You probably need to rehydrate stay hydrated when using and coming off of opiates and any other drug really Magnesium has been helping me a lot lately I heard ashwagandha root helps opioid receptors Pretty much just look into thing that help rebuild your brain and things will be a lot better long breaks are good too Yea I can go all day without anything but I wont be able to sleep with a headache like that Kinda just said fuck it I m taking opiates everyday now kinda like a prescription nothing crazy although I am snorting some roxi 30s rn lol Wish opiates weren t a big deal so I could talk to my doctor about getting something for my headache to quit I just know it would but weird with the doc I have and weird to introduce myself like that hahaa maybe soon Worse part for opiate wd to me right now is the headache at the end of the day and my bones feeling weird when I m relaxing trying to sleep Yeah it can help not sure how an interview would go tho I think kratom can give a little glassy eye effect but idk It helps with my anxiety tremendously but it is a partial opioid agonist so there could be trouble quitting it without having more anxiety n stuff Alright my bad I m tired man but look into the new world order and how the rothschilds orchestrate wars around the world Everything is part of something much bigger even drugs especially opiates and cocaine The whole opiate crisis is just to get people on cheap fent and Mexican heroin Hawaii is a expensive area and drugs probably have a higher price due to its economy and transportation Roxys are extremely risky these days most of them are pressed with fentanyl The opiate world has changed a LOT in the past decade you gotta be real careful with each batch you get now Happy you ve found something that works Kratom does wonders for many its amazing It s a good idea to keep your doses low and maybe longer time between doses and tolerance breaks But really you should be fine taking high doses for a while as long as you re fine with consuming a bunch of plant matter Also you can look into things that help your opioid receptors and metabolism to opioids Just dont let kratom take you to painkillers as those can really ruin a lot of good things in life Mix the pink10s with the blue 30s with some green 15s and white 20s Ya man opiate life was a lot better just 5 years ago haha That s an anti depressant zofran helps with nausea Kratom will help you get off the oxys try a red strain Or go to a doctor and ask for some meds to help you stop you can get prescribed Naltrexone at a pharmacy with a physician you just have to go 24 36 hrs without doing opiates beforehand It sounds like you re just getting started and if you use for another month it s just gonna make things worse Take magnesium and potassium for the weird bone feelings when you re feeling asleep and melatonin and aspirin to calm you down Just stop buying them pressys Kratom is great for that man We re just saying dont go into it expecting much of a buzz like oxy gives If you quit oxy for a few months then kratom may have a more similar effect You can get high of kratom if you take enough just dose 5grams and keep dosing 2 3grams waiting 20 30min between you ll feel really good but if you move too much you can get nauseous I take kratom pretty much everyday it for sure helps keep me from doing harder opiates when I want Just get a kilo and save it for your rainy days

1,1,1,1,None,I actually had my first sleep dream on opium today First time i used it It was so nice and i want it back so bad I was laying on my sofa for like 5 hours straight Felt like i was sleeping on clouds I fucking loved it I can t remember if i dreamed anything but i think i did But whatever it was it was such a nice feeling That s the best thing i ve heard all day Can you buy it on ebay LOOL Of course not The government doesn t want you to use opium They would rather want you hooked on heroin Everything about opium is so hard to research on google But yeah to answer your question Yes you can buy it from deep web but it isn t cheap If they re not for injecting i wonder why they come in single use airproof packaging And yeah i thought i was getting syringes with very thin needle but they re so thin i can t even get juice through them haha I tested it on my skin and it penetrates skin easily I bought them from china but i believe they are medical grade Well why can t you use addictive drugs too like opium if used responsibly It s the addiction that kills SAME DUDE Opium is a pain in the ass to research i ve found out I had 1g of some low quality opium by my guess I placed it on aluminum foil and vaped it like they did on youtube but i got almost no effect of it unless i smoked like 0 3g which is a lot I payed 30 dollars for 2 good highs That s alot imo I vaped it cause i read somewhere on reddit that only 30 of it gets absorbed if you eat it That guy may be wrong so i ll try oral next time But god i fell in love with that high D even tho it didn t make me feel as intoxicated as i thought it would Just laying in bed dreaming was seriously the best feeling OOF i want it back so baaad WHY IS THIS SO GOD DAMN EXPENSIVE ,opium^china

0,0,0,0,None,Juice and Em are my favourite artists of all time ever since I heard all girls are the same and lucid dreams years ago I gravitated towards his music watched his Instagram lives etc and couldn t believe he was gone at 21 in terms of talent juice was the best new generation freestyler no doubt most of his songs are freestyled he has over 1000 songs in the vault after 2 years on top of that he could sing and rap he was the first melody rapper I really loved Lucid dreams is 100 one of his best songs it has some of his most meaningful lyrics amazing beat and it s incredibly catchy not to mention the vocals he lays down on the track A lot of people don t like it because they re a real fan and it s too mainstream I listen to all his unreleased shit everyday and I can say with certainty lucid dreams is top 5 there s a reason it blew up to the level it did Similar to mine 1 Lean wit me 2 Lucid dreams 3 Black White 4 Robbery 5 You don t love me Mine changes every single day by the way Lean wit me black White armed and dangerous wasted these are my favourites when I m on X She saw my snapchat story when I was in a club last night it was just a photo of me and my mates but my pupils were so dilated that my eyes were basically fully black she replied to it asking at that point I just said yes no point lying No worries dude I live in U K so I never got many opportunities to see juice live but after hearing lucid dreams and all girls are the same on soundcloud I was instantly drawn in to juice and followed him ever since Instagram streams unreleased songs etc then cried for days when I heard about his death life just isn t fair but I m glad Juice got the recognition he deserved It s your opinion he has so many amazing songs that there s an argument for lots of songs to be his best it s just people think it s cool to not like lucid dreams because it was popular despite it being amazing When you start delving in to the unreleased music you find so so many amazing songs that it s basically impossible for me to make a consistent top 10 that wouldn t change ,dreams^black
1,1,1,1,None,Don t ask specially for the pure 5mg oxys This will probably come off to him like you are trying to get them for their recreational attraction and not for a legitimate reason If I were you I would just tell him that you re having bad side effects with these and that when you were on whatever ones you used to be prescribed that this wasn t happening I would also say you re open to whatever the doctor thinks will be best for you and I d give it a bit on the 5 325s to make it seem like you tried to deal with them but it wasn t working Now a days you have to be very careful when dealing with any opiate painkillers unfortunately I have the black one But if I could choose any id get the blue but only best buy has the blue I didn t like the glow too girly for me Lol You are just kicking the opiods out of the receptors not out of your body Naloxone has a very short half life so it wears off pretty quickly and then once it wears off any that is still in your body will return to those receptors and you ll have to do it all over again like you normally would That s why you can get narcaned and stop over dosing and then shortly after you can start overdosing again even if you don t do any more opiates Because narcan wears off fast and it doesn t actually rid your body of any opiates just those receptors If your end goal isn t quitting opiates then the best thing to do would be to find some suboxone from a friend or someone you know You could probably get away with taking these on a plane whether you hide them or just act like they re your prescription is up to you if it were me I d hide them though Shouldn t be too hard they re usually in strips or in small pills If you found some subs you d be good forsure no withdrawals at all Just research taking it for the first time so you don t end up going into precipitated withdrawal Nah I actually haven t been doing fent recently But I know that most people who have been doing heroin on general for any extended period of time that the regular oxys won t do anything for them other than make it so they re not sick I was doing fent for a while when I was living up north and was getting like 200 of the pressed fent oxys at a time and also was getting China that I know had fent in it Just did my last shot and need to figure out a way to come up with some money to grab some black hopefully before the game starts On my old P320 I was running the sig tritium fiber optic front sight with a stock rear sight And I really liked that setup but if you don t like having anything on the rear you can go on sigs website and buy the correct height sight that is just all black so it will be easier to pick out the front Just depends on who I go through usually a half g is about 40 though I just know a couple people with some good shit doing halfs for 30 I just moved back into my home town from living up north and was paying 50 bucks for 1 out there and 150 200 for a half gram and 350 400 for a full gram Shit was insane bro But I iv currently Best way to do tar tho In my opinion Up north I was getting a lot of China with fentanyl and thought I ruined my tolerance but didn t fuck it up too bad just was only getting shitty tar out there when it was around so I thought tar wouldn t ever touch my tolerance but with the good tar back home I can definitely still get high lol ,opiate^black^opiates^china

1,1,1,1,None,So basically after you decide to get clean from opiates you go through withdrawals I m sure you know this In the beginning say 1 5 days you go through the worst of the symptoms and you start feeling better and better However even after say a month clean you still get these bouts of what feels like minor withdrawals That s the best way I can understand it Also it stands for Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome I prob should ve said that Ahh I see what s going on Well I mean Idk how deep into addiction you were but for me I was fairly deep and met some scumbags along the way who had certain non opiate drugs that would take the edge all the way through detox so I hit them up I don t know if you know people who have access to these drugs I m talking about but if not then go the doctor and tell them your detoxing off opiates and thennnnn yeah go from there I guess So if I was in your shoes this is what I would do Im actually coming off Suboxone as I type this and have been an addict for like 8 years or so I have had bouts of significant clean time in the past and yeah anyways From what you wrote it sounds like you have a top tier detox kit however I would use as least methadone as possible It s going to suck but opiates are what your doing this for in the first place What worked WONDERS for me was benzodiazepines You said you have Valium right The first week I was getting clean off subs I don t even remember I mean I don t condone drug use and a lot of people give me shit for telling people to take benzos for withdrawal but that worked so good for me Also you have lyrica I had gabapentin I love weed too lol I used a very similar kit minus the methadone and it was virtually painless like 1 10 pain and it went by super fast Dont be scared Also be careful mixing all of those that could be bad It s not really about luck but I ll send u some anyways ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Headache and brain fog is the only symptom That seems rather normal I would imagine As any hot sweats anxiety insomnia apparently have passed for you I m sure some Advil working out eating right staying hydrated will fix you up Also depends how long you were using Kratom and if it was stemming from an issue with Other opiates Well knowing dose is key I don t know what you mean by best way to take If a capsule swallow if powder mix with drink What exactly are you on What opiates If you went 3 days with no real symptoms do it again From Kratom You must have been taking a lot o et long period or switched from a harder opiate Like in the first few days of quitting opiates Is it safe to assume you bought headshop gas station extracts If your able to taper your opiate of Choose DO It I will say if it s dope switch to real oxy or something cuz you can t really determine how much of xyz is In your dope will just makes it much easier There s a chance you got Kratom that has Opiate analogues in it There was some headship brand a while back that was found to be contaminating their product with some unscheduled opiate similar time tramadol codeine ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Hahahaha I know I started seeing them more n more lately in family Guy and American Dad Lots of opiate references I think we all take opiates to overshadow pain that we don t wanna necessarily face I got on subs with a game plan though I got on it not cause I was spinning out of control but because I didn t have any structure If you asked me what is THE reason you even got into opiates I wouldn t have a direct answer for that But subs provided a schedule it allowed me to stop worrying about shit I had no control over it allowed me to wake up every morning with a smile on my face and go to work live my life Depression runs in my family obviously alongside anxiety So yeah along with therapy subs definitely help me see the reasons why I still get up every single day to do what I gotta do 2mg is a lot for someone who s hardly had opiates And for someone to try n say she s one of those people who don t get any relief from opiates that s not a good enough reason lol Ya know Cause that s A LOT That will make most opiate naive people throw the fuck up for a day n a half ,opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,they give methadone for mat because it keeps people off the harder stuff when suboxone treatment fails it keeps people alive thats all like for instance i took suboxone and i kept using it didnt work for me methsdone does because its a stronger opioid it get you high just like suboxone but its just gets you higher some people need that to stay abstinent from fent everyones different mat can be used for the short term for people who can ween off and stay clean or it can be used for the long nothing wrong with the long term either if thats whats best for the person ive been on methadone for 11 years now im in good health i have been a manager of a store for 10 years now have kids a house gf etc i might be on for life and thats ok give urself another 10 years in this life and you should understand the situation better but hope i provided some insight gl thanks i am up until now a somewhat functioning addict been using all opiates and opioids for 14 years i have everything going for me but my addiction 3 year old son brand new car manager at a gnc store gf house eveverything but im falling apart on the inside and its time for a change i will follow god for my family has and are doing great i want and need god just havnt done it yet ,opioid^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Really That s weird Did you ever like not shit before when you weren t active I know on real opiates The only problem I had were my shits were like really hard I still usually shit at least once every 2 days But I play soccer and move around a lot so that could help I also started taking vitamins and fiber based stuff a lot No I was saying in his story he got hooked to bupe first on the street and not like full agonist opiates like oxy or herion I feel like most people get high on the full opiates for a long time first and then when they can t afford or support their habit somehow they would get prescribed bupe to come off or do bupe to help with WDs from the full agonist opiates I was on opiates for 3 years and just started bupe a week ago and it was the first time I ever did subs I just feel like you really can t abuse subs or get high from them like a traditional opiate But you will def become dependent on the bupe over time when it s prescribed And for me I plan on staying on subs for like 6 months max just to get my funds and life back together Yea no I get that with the full opiate agonist It s because your tolerance shoots up which means you had to take much more which means you get more negative side effects like that But with the subs I don t get like that ,opiates^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,I have tried the Green strain It feels like mild opioid high Basically you need to find the strain that suits you But I have heard from many that the green ones feels like opioid high Started with Tramadol 100mg first time just once it was one of the most powerful feeling I ever felt Then found alot of Codeine at home 1 year after I tried Trams Ate them all and thats when I fell in love with opioids The strongest opioid I tried was oxycodone 30mg Shit it hit so hard that I slept lol Since then I use opioids responsibly My favorite is Tramadol since I can get of it easy Oxy gave me withdrawals after 2 time use So I save them for very special moments Never tried it What is it exactly Is it opioid And can you get addicted ,opioid
1,1,1,1,None,okok i understand i feel kinda disrespectful rn is there some other opiate that would do the same with less harm i ll reconsider my choice what opiate would you recommend which has somewhat the same effect i m looking for that nodding off type shit ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Good question indeed My wife who used to take acid coke and mdma with me when we were dating and who still likes to smoke pot tells me every time when that topic comes up to never ever tell our kids about my drug use or her past drug experiences Our kids are still toddlers so I don t know yet how to address that topic but I do know that I will not stick to the typical parent bullshit propaganda of drugs are evil just because I and the government say so but rather educate them about their real risks I will warn them about the real dangers of drugs For example what opioids did to me and how many of my old friends died because of them I still battle an ongoing addiction to medically prescribed morphine Used to do heroin too but got over it with the help of my addictioligist yet I m still addicted to opioid painkillers these days Which is a downward spiral that I never ever want my kids to fall into Opiate withdrawl and the endless circle to just feel normal is something I wouldn t wish upon my greatest enemy When it comes to pot and psychedelics I would like to educate them properly that they have all the time in the world to explore these things if they wish to but only once their minds and brains are fully developed meaning over 21 I want to teach them to reach their full intellectual potential without chemicals Same goes for most other drugs humans get high since the days of ancient Rome Athens or Alexandria They have their place in history but all of them have so much destructive potential if used frequent and while being too young I want them to at least not damage their brains and bodies while they are still teenagers Daily use aka addictions 1 Opiates 300 400mg morphine hcl 2 Cannabis 1g of weed or 0 5g of hashish 3 Nicotine 1 pack of cigarettes Substances I enjoy occasionally in a non addictive behavior 1 Psychedelics LSD Psilocybin Mescaline DMT 2CB 2 Dissociatives Ketamine PCP and their RC substitutes 3 Uppers Entheogens MDMA Amphetamine Ritalin Coke 4 Benzos Diazepam Alprazolam Depression Melancholia post operative chronic pain narcisstic and or borderline behavior Ecstasy spiked with opiates is another bullshit teenage urban legend People told me the same lies 20 years ago These days in Europe pills get tested professionaly in almost every country Some contain amphetamine along with the mdma some contain a psychedelic like 2cb but never ever in known history there were tested pills with mdma and heroin or any other opiate going around It s bullshit myths like this that make this subreddit so cringeworthy A year is easy I was using opiates on and off for 10 years all throughout my 20s Never got addicted Until I had to undergo 5 surgeries with lots of physical pain coupled with mental pain by my dad dying and my then girlfriend leaving me That s when addiction finally hit me It s not about willpower it s about circumstances Heavy physical and emotional trauma mixed with long going scripts for heavy painkillers get you there And then it s almost no turning back anymore Anyone who thinks they won t get addicted because they successfully flirted with opiates for a year or two without ever withdrawing is lying to themselves All it takes is life itself hitting you hard And as my 3rd comment you don t have to be scared on a stronger dose either The known maximum amount of black market lsd blotters is in the 200 to 250mcg range No lab will lay stronger blotters for a mass market Now 200 to 250mcg is considered a full psychedelic dose It s the same dose Albert Hofmann tried on his first self experiment with lsd The visuals and the mind trip will be stronger in that range but it s not at all unpleasant with the right set and setting A bad set and setting can be hell on 120mcg and vice versa Personally I prefer mid to high doses of lsd to small ones as it s much easier to go with the flow of the experience as it sucks you in Lower doses can make me paranoid whereas 200mcg plus forces my mind to just let the psychedelic do its work fighting against it is no longer an option if you understand what I mean I had the same experience with lsd If you dose opiates in my case it was either opium or heroin back then simultaneously to your psychedelic of choice it will kill the trip almost immediatly What does work great though is taking your opiates at the tail end of the trip for a smooth comedown Did this several times lately with pharmaceutical hydromorphone or morphine and it worked great every time If you are addicted to opiates but want to trip on psychedelics I d suggest to take your poison of choice a few hours before you trip Just take enough to not go into withdrawal during your trip and do more once the comedown sets in Nothing is better than to slowly transform the psychedelic rush into nodding and daydreaming while getting sleepy and comfy under warm blankets To me this felt like dozing off in an Victorian opium den 19th century style Ketamine is the best combo for nearly every psychedelic Throwing mdma in the mix can be very fun and re recreational as well Opiates at the tail end of the experience can make the comedown very smooth and pleasurable My favourite combo LSD 6hours later 2CB 1 hour later Mdma and after I peaked twice on lsd and 2cb add 100mg Ketanest via I M application for a deep k hole While exiting the parallel universe of k land I like to finish me off with 100 150mg morphine hcl Oh and weed hash is an essential from the start Low doses of benzos can be administers if one is having an unpleasant experience but that s very unlikely with this combo If I would have one day left on earth to experience nothing but pleasure this would be my to go mix Dmt is much more colorful and visual 5meo has no oevs only black and white cevs What they share in similar experiences is that both can lead to the most realistic simulation of death ego death known to me I had entity contact on dmt never on 5meo 5meo experiences also tend to be for me more on the rough and dark side being pushed in an eternal circle of life and death and suffering whereas dmt has an Alice in wonderland kind of uplifting feel everything is crazy but it s OK and kind of fun What my good doctor told me lately in defense of the evil sadistic ones these docs treat you bad because they are afraid of getting charged and or loosing their license due to the ongoing opioid epidemic crazyness in politics and media Before they risk getting in trouble for writing you a decent script they prefer to chase you away by threats accusations and lies Most of them are not evil in nature but rather scared of destroying their career or getting jailed themselves by supplying a patient that might look like an abuser with opioid scripts His view made sense to me on second thought Doesn t change the fact that there are more than enough fucktards out there with medical diplomas who enjoy emposing their power over you and seeing you withdrawal from the very same meds they prescribed to you in the first place I know man Not too proud of this habbit either especially since I became a father of twin toddlers Their mum is a lawyer working against human trafficking and weapons and drug trade so my hobbies and addictions are not too welcome in family life Until this summer I was on 24mg hydromorphone ER plus 6x 2 6mg IR Plus the occasional heroin binge on top Then my old doctor who s been prescribing me opioids since 5 years got under opioid epidemic surveillance and suddenly accused me of not needing the pain meds any longer and actually being a junky and dropped my dosage to 2x4mg a day Needless to say I was in almost unbearable withdrawal In the following months I spent almost all of my savings on dope heroin sometimes pretty pure other times fent laced and was visiting 3 other pain doctors who all either turned me down accused me of being a junky or wanted to send me to rehab While I know I m addicted to opiates I also have real chronic pain after 4 surgeries on my spine and two on my elbow which left me with constant nerve pain and inflammations Luckily in November I finally met a new pain doc addictiologist I was completely honest with him about my usage of everything which the urine test verified anyhow but I thought I better start this thing without any more lies and to my surprise he turned out to be an super understanding non judgemental doc He put me on 400mg extended release morphine and didn t even force me to quit Marijuana as he knows it helps people in my situation Only thing he was really strict about was to never ever use heroin again especially these days with so many cutting agents and fentanyl analoges in the dope He also asked me to stop benzos for good and only use them as a last resort thing After I followed his orders and the urine samples only came out positive for morphine and thc he became almost friendly towards me and didn t treat me like a piece of shit addict like the other recent docs did His biggest fear for me was either ODing on cut heroin or getting in trouble with the police So yes it is a pretty big dose but it also allowed me to get out of the vicious heroin circle And I am so fucking grateful to finally have found a doc again who trusts me and is willing to prescribe what it takes to deal with the chronic pain issues During the breakup with the back then love of my life I also had to undergo 5 surgeries on my spine The pain from the operations coupled with the emotional trauma of the break up being all alone lead me to a serious opioid addiction that to this very day is still impregnated in my brain I start each day with 300mg morphine hcl up my butt If I could go back in time I would urge my younger self not to seek peace in addictive chemicals I know it s not easy But I wouldn t want you to go the same path as me with benzos Hole yourself into another universe with the ketamine but please don t fall into the benzo trap Wishing you I m taking extended release morphine daily for pain management No problems while mixing it with ketamine except its more likely to throw up so get yourself in a safe position before entering the hole A positive side effect of using k along with opiates ketamine seems to have synergies with morphine in its pain blocking activities After a day on k I can usually lower my typical dose of morphine by 30 to 50 for a few days for pain managent or if used normally the ketamine allows me to fully feel the euphoric effects of morphine again which normally subside with regular use once physical addiction sets in I never tried that one but speaking in terms of potency 100mg of morphine hcl used orally never got me really high or nodding out Its my favorite opiate in terms of pain management analgesia and it helped me tremendously to get off the heroin train and it s withdrawal trainstations But for a decent high rush those 100mg needed to be boofed Never tried IV or IM application as I only do this with sealed pharmaceutical vials and the morphine hcl came in ER pills If you want to have the typical dreamy carefree euphoric high you either have to do 100mg via your butthole or you need to take much more orally depends on tolerance of corse for me it s 300 to 400mg of the er formula but then I feel it for over 24 hours Opium is for home use Dissos are great for museums and exhibitions I literarily got lost in paintings while visiting the Prado in Madrid Ketamine is the best combo for nearly every psychedelic Throwing mdma in the mix can be very fun and re recreational as well Opiates at the tail end of the experience can make the comedown very smooth and pleasurable My favourite combo LSD 6hours later 2CB 1 hour later Mdma and after I peaked twice on lsd and 2cb add 100mg Ketanest via I M application for a deep k hole While exiting the parallel universe of k land I like to finish me off with 100 150mg morphine hcl Oh and weed hash is an essential from the start Low doses of benzos can be administers if one is having an unpleasant experience but that s very unlikely with this combo If I would have one day left on earth to experience nothing but pleasure this would be my to go mix Yeah opiates could be the best thing ever Wouldn t there be addiction and those very real and brutal withdrawal effects That s what smashes you to pieces in the end Umm yes I mean it depends where you live I guess I live in a city of 2 million people so the statistics that everyone and their dog knows at least one person selling black market drugs and or pharmaceuticals is pretty high If you re also coming from more liberal artsy education circles chances are high nearly 50 percent of your friends like to get high too And of those 50 half of them have their own plug the rest share it with them These circles get less close once you finish college university and follow the mo to fr job office career routine But every time you re in need to go back to your relatively careless days at campus those old friends are still there to call and meet up That means if they didn t die in the last 10 years which is usually the case in 1 out of 5 these days 4 close friends of my youth have died meanwhile either by suicide or by opioid overdose So yes you don t have to live in a ghetto to get involved Actually it s the opposite ,opiate^opiates^black^opium^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,Please tell me you are not carrying someone else s piss in your tits at all times to pass just fucking weed If so I find that so hilarious like the thought has me roaring If you are under 18 your parents can t kick you out and when you are over 18 they don t have authority to demand you take a drug test I would just tell them that you are using weed and that nothing they can do will stop you and they can do what they like with that information Accept it or get mad you don t care it doesn t effect you if they wanna run circles in their heads they can This worked for all my friends that tried it and the ONE that didn t he still gets treated like a 8 year old at 23 If you are using harder drugs I guess it s up to you to decide but ultimately I see being honest as a good thing Like if opiates then your parents can get narcan so if you OD you don t die When I was 16 I told my mom I was smoking weed and she was very mad but over a year she accepted it By 19 she knew I was doing coke oxy Xanax basically trying everything She understands that alcohol is just as bad and can easily lead to addiction Also if you are upfront in the future if you freak out and have a mental one it happens more than you think with drugs if you are a daily user they will know what is going on and can calm you down I use to wake up to a half gram line of cocaine when I was a daily user I would still be using if it didn t stop being good for me Now when I use it I have to take opiates or xanax because I get paranoid and if I use too much I will induce psychosis I had a ball of pure for new years and that was too much I was psychotic for a day after even with opiates I only do pure I test my supply and I know how to wash it Don t overdo it and ruin it altogether for yourself like I did Treat it with respect and it will show that respect back to you in the form of blissful highs and no comedowns Yeah moderation is key I use hard opiates once a month oxy or heroin and have been for 7 years I have even tried the needle 2 years ago and deemed it not worth the hassle I was a previous addict to benzo but at least I can own it and choose not to buy them Now I just use coke on bday and New Years opiates once a month and I use weed daily but tend to have one week off a month Drugs are so much better now I moderate them and I am a better person I just as happy without drugs which is how it should be Drugs to run away from your problems is a big bad but if your life is in tact it is like icing on an already delicious cake I use opiates once month sometimes less and have been for 7 years I usually go for 80mg Oxy or the equivalent in heroin Due to the fact I have 0 tolerance each time I have a massive 5 hour nod which is enhanced with weed The nod is like a lucid dream and is so vivid it feels real and I don t realize until I open my eyes and figure out that this is actually reality The euphoria is pretty strong too I can see why homeless people use or people depressed in poverty use everyday despite knowing they will get physically addicted If you have nothing or live in poverty the nod is so strong you will feel like you are living in a mansion with models and unlimited money Whatever you want it will and can trick you delude you into believing in a reality that doesn t even exist I m fortunate enough when I come down I am happy to be back where I am Most the time I use nowadays I don t nod about having money I feel like I m a bird flying above random countries My favorite was Egypt I can t experience this anyway in real life so I have to use opiates to get my bird fantasy fix Yeah I tell people if you are gunna get addicted physically to anything at least pick opiates The high is way better and benzo withdrawals make any opiate withdrawal look like a walk in the park Why are people defending her she basically said all white people are ugly If I went oh look she works in a liquor store she must be poor all black people are poor Everyone would lose it ,opiates^opiate^black

1,1,1,1,None,Vyvanse junkie here Vyvanse s effects are pretty much indistinguishable to Adderall Meth Coke Extreme focus interest and pleasure gained from any task no matter how trivial or boring If you sit down for 5 min you will get extremely restless and bored There s also a constant flow of adrenaline that kinda keeps you on edge and makes it hard to sit still As a result your heart beats faster your blood pumps harder and doing simple physical tasks like running or climbing up stairs can be extremely difficult I basically have no appetite and the thought of eating makes me sick Food feels dry and flavorless and like your body is rejecting it Eat a nutrient dense meal before taking the pill to ensure you won t have a bad comedown physically if you can t bring yourself to eat Hearing ringing in your ears to the point of deafness or getting extremely dizzy are common Strangely though in this mindset the head rush you sometimes get can feel immensely pleasurable You can try to trigger the rush yourself if your curious by laying down for 10 15 minutes and standing up really quickly It only really happens to me when I take 100 mg but since you have no tolerance maybe that will do it for you It s weird as fuck but in a kinda indescribable way it s oddly pleasurable The euphoria is extreme Probably the strongest of any substance I have ever tried You just feel this wave of relaxation and stimulation constantly flowing throughout your body You love yourself and the world and everything around you and become extremely confident and social Socially and academically this is actually pretty dangerous because to be honest it totally does make you like the perfect version of yourself to you and to others which also feels really good These are all of the wholesome emotional effects though and the rush or buzz that people are usually chasing is very hard to describe If you ve ever tried weed or opiates I would describe their euphoria as warm but amph euphoria feels more like this smooth cool buzzing of pleasure in your head The effects kick in around 30min and peak at 3 4 hours From that point the effects will slowly ramp downward for 8 10 hours until your pretty much back to normal I wouldn t expect to be able to sleep though as I ve done the math and learned the lesson over and over and over You can not sleep until 16 18 hours after dosing This is super fucking annoying but there s no way around it except smoking a shit ton of weed or taking a Xanax or something so you just have to comply Fair warning though before experiencing this I didn t even understand addiction and could always easily and control and pace myself with no problem But the fucking second I started to feel this feeling go away when I first tried Vy I IMMEDIATELY took more Later after trying real speed and shit I realized I actually like d amphetamine what Vyvanse is converted to more than I like regular amphetamine and so do a lot of people This also means though that Vyvanse is more addictive to me than meth because it s my DoC Also I started to understand why people snort drugs because having to wait 1 5h for each pill to take effect is a big problem when you are stim fiending and just need something in your system now Now over a year and a relapse later I am still helplessly addicted to and dependent Vy So have fun be safe and most importantly be VERY CAREFUL about your usage It s easy to think that because it s pharma and just a pill it s not that dangerous but it is literally one molecule off of meth and in my case even more addictive Oh and also never mix alcohol with like anything It has a fuck ton of interactions and most of them are not great While overdosing on opiates most of the time you don t understand what s going on or even if you do you don t care at all and barely feel any pain physical or mental because the drug just numbs you completely to that level of emotion or sensation Your father had a peaceful death Look like Klonopin 0 5mg s Got the same pill with the same symbol it s pharma just yellow not blue If this is Oxy and you weren t just scammed with benzo s dunno if opiate dealers do this then they re definitely presses Proceed with caution Really shitty dirt cheap bud sprinkled with a very small amount of fentanyl basically just feels like a stronger more addictive version of weed Also drug dealers are always willing to risk killing their weed customers in an effort to turn them into opiate cocaine addicts Turns out hard drug addicts spend a loooot of money on drugs I can never tell if people are kidding when they say shit like this cuz I figure if you actually did heroin you wouldn t call it black tar heroin but also why would you say this if it wasn t true ,opiates^opiate^black

1,1,1,1,None,Are you sure it s the SSRI aspect of tramadol that makes you feel like that and not the opioid aspect Many opioid users I know say opioids are the only thing that makes them feel like a normal person That applies to me in a huge sense morphine or really any other full agonist opioid is the only thing that makes me feel comfortable in my own skin When you feel like that it s easy as fuck to get hooked I want to be like that again 24 7 was almost the exact same thing I said when I first took oxy I was taken by a huge level of euphoric energy and just walked from the living room to the kitchen and from the kitchen to the living room thinking my GOD I want to feel like this FOREVER One month later I was hooked Be careful Oxycodone is not converted into morphine it s actually converted into noroxycodone and oxymorphone And most opiates aren t turned into morphine either only a few opioids are metabolized into it like codeine heroin and nicomorphine But opioids kinda make you hallucinate in a way don t they Although not in the psychedelyc sense I mean that s why opium addicts were said to have a dreaming habit The book Confessions of an English Opium Eater is full of reports of hallucinations the writer had while he was nodding on the stuff In principe of course it s possible But very very few people can actually mantain the moderation in the long run The relief opioids provide is just amazing it kills all kinds of psychological pain It fixes everything in this sense You can use it in moderation for years and then one day a loved one dies you lose your job and you just justify using it more often to deal with the pain It s hard to not let it turn into a way of dealing with your problems Heroin is just another opioid under the sun Intravenously it s just morphine with an even more intense rush than regular morphine But it s illegality makes it more dangerous than pharma opioids since you never know how much you re taking If you live in the US or Canada there has never been a time more dangerous to be a heroin user than today s given the fent advent In a way it s even more dangerous if you use it in moderation since regular users at least have a tolerance which makes them less likely to OD Although they also use it everyday multiple times which in this sense makes regular users more likely to OD Kind of a paradox here Maybe that s where the glory lies once your body starts to crave the blanket the fact that Everything will pass The pain the buzz the hurt Its like coming face to face with your own mortality And having the calm presence of mind to not be alarmed or frightened by the current of life and death Dude What you said made me remember a great article The alkaloids that opioids contain have a large effect on the human brain because they tap into our natural mu opioid receptors The oxytocin we experience from love or friendship or orgasm is chemically replicated by the molecules derived from the poppy plant It s a shortcut and an instant intensification of the happiness we might ordinarily experience in a good and fruitful communal life It ends not just physical pain but psychological emotional even existential pain And it can easily become a lifelong entanglement for anyone it seduces a love affair in which the passion is more powerful than even the fear of extinction When we see the addicted stumbling around like drunk ghosts or collapsed on sidewalks or in restrooms their faces pale their skin riddled with infection their eyes dead to the world we often see only misery What we do not see is what they see In those moments they feel beyond gravity entranced away from pain and sadness In the addict s eyes it is those who are sober who are asleep That is why the police and EMS workers who rescue those slipping toward death by administering blasts of naloxone a powerful antidote without which death rates would be even higher are almost never thanked They are hated They ruined the high And some part of being free from all pain makes you indifferent to death itself Death is after all the greatest of existential pains Everything one achieves in life even love occurs in an express train racing toward death Cocteau observed To smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving It is to concern oneself with something other than life or death Source http nymag com intelligencer

machine unveiled in vancouver amp In the past I used to drink at least once a week in order to drown my sorrows The day I tried dope for the first time that was it no more alcohol for me The relief opioids provide me is so much better so much cleaner so much more natural than alcohol and it s nasty effects Thus I rarely drink nowadays as in once every two to three years or so As Thomas De Quincey once wrote I do not readily believe that any man having once tasted the divine luxuries of opium will afterwards descend to the gross and mortal enjoyments of alcohol Several studies have shown that when users get access to prescription heroin their tolerance tends to stabilize at a certain dosage rather than increase endlessly and when their tolerance gets stable then the tendency is for users to voluntarily reduce their dosages rather than increase them For example Gschwend P Rehm J Blättler R et al Dosage Regimes in the Prescription of Heroin and Other Narcotics to Chronic Opioid Addicts in Switzerland Swiss National Cohort Study European Addiction Research 2004 10 41 48 This naturalistic descriptive study of dosages of patients in the Swiss PROVE narcotic prescription program between 1994 1996 found that heroin was most common 77 as injection and 9 as inhalation followed by oral methadone usually in combination with heroin The authors concluded During the course of treatment the mean dosage for injectable heroin per day decreased significantly and depending on the treatment regime almost linearly During the treatment period dosages did not increase but generally decreased indicating no further increase in tolerance Dosages declined even when patients chose their own daily regime Drug Policy Alliance Annotated Bibliography Heroin Assisted Treatment Concerns that HAT may encourage drug use have proven unfounded The EMCDDA and other reviews found that rather than patients increasing their heroin doses they stabilised and often started reducing them usually within two or three months and uptake of other treatments also increased HAT also helped reduce heroin availability and recruitment of new users by medicalising use and reducing street dealing and the number of user dealers Clinics are also sited only where a street injecting problem already exists and have soon won strong support from the public when their effectiveness is demonstrated for example being backed by a resounding majority in a national referendum in Switzerland Heroin Assisted Treatment HAT Saving lives improving health reducing crime I ve made a post about it some time ago https www reddit com r opiates comments bukav8 debunking myths longterm heroin use is Buprenorphine is usually worse than shorter acting full agonists in the physical dependency aspect since withdrawals from it are just hell Full agonist opioids are worse in the psychological addiction sense because unless you have no significant tolerance opioids such as oxycodone or hydromorphone tend to feel more euphoric than buprenorphine They last shorter than bupe too which adds to their addiction potential As far as damage to the body opioids in general usually are almost harmless in this sense They re not toxic to organs at all like cocaine or alcohol to give you examples I don t know much about tapering In principle shorter acting opioids would be better for tapering since they don t accumulate in the body as much as longer acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine But in real life practice very few people can actually follow through a tapering with shorter acting opioids like oxycodone and morphine precisely because they feel so good and you just don t want to reduce the dose You want that feel good feeling and you want it completely So if you don t have a doctor gradually enforcing the tapering but rather are doing the tapering by yourself it seems it would be usually better to try to do it with a longer acting and not so euphoric at least not for people with a significant tolerance opioid like bupe Yes in Switzerland you re required to have at least two years of opioid dependency and at least two prior treatment attempted Almost no one is getting prescribed dilaudid or heroin for addiction I know it happens but it s too rare to be worth discussing here Hydromorphone and diamorphine maintenance are getting expanded each year that passes and are actually one of the most efficient ways to treat serious addicts So it s definitely worth discussing However as long as getting high is your primary goal you re probably fooling yourself into thinking that it can stay an easily managed habit like having a glass of wine at night Well yeah it shouldn t be one s primary goal but getting high indeed is part of life of many people who are on maintenance They wake up go to work come home and nod off And that s it All I m saying is that it doesn t matter at all and if it doesn t matter maintenance shouldn t really be defended in the grounds of it doesn t make people high because it does make some people high although not everyone and it s not an issue most of the time but if you still want to use opiates every night to get high then you re not really in recovery and more to the point you re still going to live a life that revolves around the drug Wel as I said I don t care about arbitrary standards of what recovery is I care about stability about improving in life and staying away from crime If maintenance got me stable and away from street drugs I may not be clean but I do think I m recovered in a very significant sense whether I get high when I come home or not The other issue is that as long as you chase a high you re going to have your tolerance steadily go up See this is a myth Every research about this issue found that the tolerance of people on injectable heroin maintenance stabilizes at a certain point It gets stable and then many of them actually decrease the dose Most of them stabilize at half a gram a day So of course they feel that great rush and sometimes get high but opioid tolerance tends to stabilize I have a whole post quoting all the research about this issue https www reddit com r opiates comments bukav8 debunking myths longterm heroin use is https www reddit com r opiates comments bukav8 debunking myths longterm heroin use is Many people prefer diazepam over alprazolam actually I don t like benzos but I myself think Valium is just as good or maybe even more relaxing as far as benzos goes Klonopin I just kinda hate tho such a long lasting benzo and particularly uncomfortable As for the huge buprenorphine doses the purpose is to fill all opioid receptors in the brain so that the user can t get high on junk I would never accept such a thing because I know I can t stay away from junk and being on such a huge dose of buprenorphine would just make my tolerance skyrocket for no good reason I ve read an article about doctors prescribing morphine sulfate for IV use as a maintenance tool to a few problematic users in France I fully support that I ve also read that heroin use went down in France after the quality of the drug went down and the price increased in 2011 so that many users switched to morphine because it gives an effect similar enough to heroin when injected and that only some old users actually kept using H That remained the case even after 2013 when purity increased again That made me think that France finds itself is in an interesting scenario right now They could expand the injectable morphine maintenance thing to more users and keep the opioid problem in control in most part as Switzerland did with it s heroin maintenance program or they could restrict access to morphine so that it will be scarce and thus heroin will make a strong return to the streets of France to supply the demand of users who have lost the access to morph and thus ODs will increase It s up to the government to do the right thing but they don t do the right nor the wrong decision they just let the situation which as it is may be controled stay the same which is dangerous As someone who actually lives in France what do you think about that Naloxone indeed is an opioid blocker but buprenorphine has a higher affinity to the opioid receptors than naloxone Naloxone just won t work it can t compete with bupe I m an opioid addict I m stable on 90 120mg of IV morphine It gets me high for years I don t need to increase my dose ever at all although I do in very rare instances I m not talking about chasing a high My point is that IV opioid tolerance gets stable as it s proven in the link I provided above If you re stable in a dose that makes you high you don t need to chase it It s stable That s what happens with most peole on IV heroin maintenance They get high but their tolerances stabilized They don t chase a high or push further because they re stable I don t think I can become addicted because where I live all you see is fucking crystal meth never opiates I thought there was plenty of heroin in Australia although very expensive ,opioid^opiates^opium^black
0,0,0,0,None,The guitar has nothing to do with it it s the melody Juice is singing in Listen to the Yellowcard song and sing Lucid Dreams at the hook It s incredibly similar my guy Huge Juice fan but you re insane if you think Lucid Dreams and the Yellowcard track have no similarities ,dreams
0,1,1,1,None,Oh yeah okay I m tracking now Yeah if you ve had any kind of psychotic episodes psychedelics probably aren t the best idea unless you re doing them under the care of a trained professional like your therapist I m so sorry you re going through it darlin I can t speak to the ketamine thing because while the research I ve done has shown nothing but incredible results I haven t tried it personally I ve just done a TON of research The FDA here in the US has just recently approved a form of ketamine esketamine in a nasal spray for treatment resistant depression but I don t know anyone who s actually been prescribed it The studies do look VERY promising though There are a ton of ketamine clinics here that do IV infusions for depression but none are covered by insurance not like everyone here can afford insurance but that s beside the point so there exorbitantly expensive your average person can t afford the thousands of dollars it costs to access that treatment Aaaaand now I m just rambling I m so glad you have one doctor you can be completely honest with because that s absolutely crucial it sounds like your therapist is amazing I m sorry your GP was dickish but at the same time I can understand why he would be concerned about you self medicating your mental health issues with opiates because that s a HUGE indicator of active addiction or that you re headed toward active addiction very quickly Regardless I m super proud of you for having the balls to be honest with your medical team for TRYING to get better whatever that looks like I have questions if you don t mind When you say your doc didn t react well when you told him you re essentially self medicating your mental health issues with opiates what exactly happened there Because it sounds like you ve been honest about it with your psych that doc is at least trying to help you be as safe as possible so what happened with your other doc what does that one specialize in You mention getting your meds from a pain clinic so is that one your pain mgt doc Secondly when you say your psych prescribed ketamine as a treatment for your depression when was that how exactly did that go down She just wrote you a script that you filled at your regular ol community pharmacy I m super curious about this I ve never known anyone that managed to get their doctor to get on board with ketamine treatments not even the most severe cases of treatment resistant depression with some of the worst suicidal ideations ever it s incredibly sad tbh Lastly have you your psych considered ECT I know that s an extremely drastic last line therapy but when it s that or the patient offing themselves Or have you tried microdosing psychedelics I ve heard truly AMAZING things about the effects of microdosing both LSD psilocybin not both simultaneously of course but I can t really speak to that personally because while I ve tried it with LSD I wasn t super consistent I didn t dose volumetrically I procured the lowest dose tabs I could find they were either 105 or 110 microgram Gammagoblin tabs cut each tab into 16 pieces ingested one piece the first time then a piece a half the second time but with them being on blotter paper there s really no way of knowing exactly how many micrograms were on each piece so I really should have gone the volumetric route Anyway I say all of that to say that I didn t really notice a difference because I was so inconsistent didn t follow any kind of dosing schedule my two doses were months apart But I ve really been thinking about giving it another go being consistent with it this time just because I ve read SO much about how helpful it is with treatment resistant depression because like you I ve been on every antidepressant known to man nothing has helped At best they just make me into a zombie that makes me easier for everyone around me to tolerate but they don t help me feel any better I m so far past being done with making myself into a fucking zombie just so other people are more comfortable Benzos are such a godsend in hospice care especially the longer acting ones When my grandmother was at the end of her fight with cancer she got downright combative had NO idea what was going on around her she didn t even recognize us anymore the benzo opioid combo were the only thing that kept her comfortable Also I feel you on the dad thing I lost mine unexpectedly four years ago next month two days after my birthday no one has any idea why because they didn t do a full autopsy they just called it natural causes left it at that even though everyone says it gets easier it hasn t It still sucks just as much as the day I got the call You aren t alone in those feels friend That s a very kind thought thank you This shit with the DEA has created a whole new demand for black market opioids I m so sorry you re going through this especially with you being so young Unfortunately the chances of her medical team taking any suggestions from you about which meds to use or doses is pretty much nonexistent I m assuming she s unconscious If so they ll base their case off of signs of pain like her respiratory rate any verbal cues muscle spasms such There s a fine line when someone is opiate naive between properly treating their pain pushing them over the edge which can lead to a malpractice suit With that being said your best bet is if you see signs that she s uncomfortable like what I mentioned above say something to her nurses The nurses are who will go to bat for her rarely the doctors because they only see her for a few minutes at a time ,opiates^opioid^black^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Yeah I m scared to come off and trying to go back living life without hiding Escape from the world and it s troubles by popping a pill and just putting reality on the back burner I ve been saying for six years I would get clean and haven t If I keep on and on I m going to be an old man that s addicted to opiates that literally wasted away his youth It hurts me a lot too bc I had a great childhood and teenage years I didn t really become an addict until I was almost 20 Before that I was great in school had many friends talked to girls every other day was a star athlete I even had tryouts to a big college for soccer and didn t even show up the first day because I had gotten high and drunk the night before My dad had sent a video tape in to the coach of me playing in high school and he told me to come out My dad is still disappointed in me for that I m sure I look back and wonder if my life could have been so much better had I just stayed home that night I was hanging with the wrong crowd at the time Then I lost my mother and my girlfriend of 8 years in the same month That s when I really fell off I pushed everyone away and would just lock myself away with oxy and video games I ve literally not left the house except for work or groceries and the like for probably five years I ve lost all of my friends and don t even want to pursue a relationship What s the point I think about different ways to kill myself daily but I just can t because I m a coward I ve never tried that so I can t speak on it But as an opiate veteran I can say with absolute conviction I wish I had never tried it All it took was one pill and I ve been enslaved for ten years I m about to be on day three and I feel like I m in hell A cold flu like hell with the walls closing in If you ever think maybe I can try just one to get a buzz do NOT do it I beg of you How would you recommend taking that I m a pro in the opiate game but a compete noob when it comes to stuff like that From what I ve seen it s a plant found in Africa and other different places I googled it for ingestion and it s showing me seeds Sorry for sounding like a moron but I have no clue what to look for lol ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Fuck them I ll help you out bud Benzodiazepines are anti anxiety medication they re good for withdrawing off of alcohol and other hard drugs and can help with seizures and muscle spasms They work extremely well for anxiety but are very very addictive Where I m from from they re called felony in a pill because you take too many you black out and do dumb shit Also for some reason they make people want to steal But Benzodiazepines are klonopins Xanax Valium Librium Ativan Edit don t start taking them When you get physically addicted and you withdraw they re deadly Also they make your anxiety 10x worse when you get used to taking them and stop ,black

1,1,1,1,None,That s not how it always starts Some people aren t lucky enough to start off by their own choice Some people put their trust in doctors who they thought knew what s best for them Then after a month taking pain killers at the doctor s prescription they re suddenly cut off and they feel horribly sick But hey their friends have pain killers and it takes away the sickness Suddenly there is a war against opiates and doctors aren t prescribing them like they used to Now it s almost impossible to get pain killers But hey Heroin is the same thing practically it s an opiate If I sniff it then it s not such a big leap but I m only going to sniff it never shoot it A few months down the line and either there isn t enough money to buy more or there is a drought at the moment I need to make the rest of this stash last Well shooting it has a much higher bioavailability and it ll stretch out the remainder of my stash Then as soon as I get more I ll go back to sniffing and never shoot again So its shot up and then there s no going back Congrats now there is one more person stuck in the vicious cycle People might think I m crazy but Thailand The 711 s sell a cough syrup that has opium in it for about 1 Tramadol is sold in almost all pharmacies These are the legal opiate highs Now people might say Thailand is super strict on drugs but not from my experience At least it depends where you go Some more remote areas of Thailand have there own law system it seems One island I was on there was a bar that sold hard drugs over the bar counter meth coke heroin ecstacy molly etc the island was owned by one man He was the big boss of the island everyone answered to him even the police and his relatives owned the bar They would sell to anyone but sometimes the police would extort foreigners they would search foreigners that just bought drugs and basically tell them its 10 000 baht to go free 333 If you couldn t pay it you d go to jail and the police wouldn t care if you said the bar is selling drugs lowkey they know But I was really chill with the police on that island by the end of my 5 month trip I was drinking whiskey at the chief s house Thailand is the craziest place I ve ever been things happen so fast and the absolute craziest shit in my life happened during that 5 month period so crazy that people think I m making up the stories so I don t tell them but man thailand is like a lawless country if you re in the right areas and know the right people Like lowkey or maybe more people know than not it s where wanted Russian criminals go to run from the law in their homeland it s where Swedes go to run shell companies it s where European millionaires hide their illegal millions like there were so many millionaires that couldn t take there money anywhere off the island so they had the absolute sickest parties There are sex shows practically in the middle of the road and that s the legal part so you could imagine the illegal shit rich people get away with If you have money in Thailand you could buy anything Shit was wild ,opiate^opium

1,1,1,1,None,Opiates in my experience kinda dull psychedelic trips for me I d recommend saving your dope for if either things get too intense or for your comedown Opiates always kinda mellow out my psychedelic trips in my experience so it depends if you want a more mellow trip or not Personally id save it for the comedown they help a lot taking the edge off for landing from your trip If you are opiate naive or have no tolerance kratom can be pretty nice and give you a mellow opiate high somewhere around codeine IME I worry that as a retaliation to the opioid epidemic the overprescription of subs is fucking tossing gas on the fire here and honestly going to increase the amount of people addicted dependent to opioids by quite a bit Don t get me wrong subs can and have helped quite a few people fight addiction and it has its place uses but prescribing 24mg a day to someone who abused a bottle of Vicodin or people who aren t even addicted to opiates is going to have so many consequences down the road here The pharmaceutical industry is so fucking wretched they contributed to this epidemic and now they re doubling down on the monster they ve created Yeah no problem Loperamide can definitely help quite a bit but it really depends on your habit and what kind of opiates you were doing A light oxy habit and they ll take most of your WDs away but if you ve been doing fentadope they might not even touch it Good luck Loperamide is the active ingredient in Imodium that you want to be looking for It s actually an opiate but it doesn t pass the blood brain barrier so it takes some of your WDs away and helps with the stomach issue Doesn t get you high unless you take doses that reach into territory of potentially fatal damage I haven t messed around with different types of magnesium but just any old supplements have worked for me How long have you been using opiates for consistently Are you physically dependent If you have zero tolerance and no physical dependency subs can get you a little high I m not sure exactly how they interact with kratom thought But yeah if you are physically dependent on opiates and take subs before you have withdrawn enough from opiates yes it will put you into precipitated withdrawals ,opiates^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,I remember getting home from school going on bluelight sniffing pills and reading Benadryl reports I m glad I m off opiates now but damn the nostalgia Why was bluelight taken down anyway That s always my go to spacing them out My regimen for dxm almost feels like ritual which imo makes th experience feel more sensual o I ll boil some water get fresh ginger root and skin it cut it into cubes put those bitches in a mason jar with some of the boiling water shake it for like 5 mins then strain and use the ginger liquid for tea usually just plain black tea with some honey then I drink it slowly when popping 5 pills x 10mins sometimes every 5 minutes if I wanna get up there The ginger tea is literally such a godsend for nausea but nothing not even some nice dabs can ever get me to not gag when eating them I had a really good trip on 60 gels 900mg I m pretty sure and was vibin until I had to shit When I got off the couch I was a lump on the couch before having to use the bathroom and get every gel inside my stomach It took 4 seconds for me to waddle run down the hallway and promptly like my guts out I was even planning on taking a 480mg trip tonight but I don t think I can do it quite yet Edit I made it to the toilet should have specified I love sitting on my bed in near pitch black frying off 600mg smoking a blunt and playing ESO there s not really much that can top that if you can get the synergy right Sorry I guess that was my fault lol Whenever I got down and dirty with DMT once I Vaped 85mg from a rig and that s actually the trip that made me say this I was panicking so much and was looking at all these different machines entities and realities as if they were giant mirror like things that I could walk into think the Super Mario 64 paintings and how you can jump into them Bit by bit the room began to dissolve tiny little cubes of my immediate vision began to break off and evaporate until my vision was black just me and pure Oblivion It was at that point that i didn t realize I hadn t breathed for what felt like hours and quickly began breathing fast as to avoid brain damage due to lack of oxygen I have no clue what it looks like from a sober perspective but when I smoke DMT my friends sitters all say I like to hold my breath for a few seconds let it all out then hold my breath again and the higher dosages I Vaped the longer I held my breath It wasn t so much I forgot how to breathe moreso that it felt like looking at what I was being shown was more important lmao Also the words please and breathe kept echoing more like a word vortex anyone that knows what thinking on DMT is like will know what I mean and in no particular order Strange trip but good advice ,opiates^black

1,1,1,1,None,Truth dude I know exactly what you re talking about I mean to be fair eyeballing little amounts is one thing but as I m sure you know a lot of dudes seem to be literally trying to max out how much dope they can load in the syringe like you know where they got the plunger 90 back so far you can barely reach it And even worse those fools who judge the strength of a shot by how dark it is Like they don t get that the cuts make it dark not the dope WTF lol Dumbass who take perfectly good powder and add loads of sugar to it and fry it to make imitation shitty black tar heroin that taste more sugar sweet than heroin bitter These low down Harm Reduction estranged dope heads I hung out with in Central Ohio I mean these guys took the cake for fragrant disregard for all common sense not just safety precautions They reused rigs 10 times shot crack with lemon juice without so much as boiling to sterilize The worst part was it took me almost 2 years to unlearn all the trashy stupid as fuck ways of doing it I d learned from these shit heads to be sure not cause they were opi heads only cause they were trashy as living fuck The crown jewel You believe this Ear wax to help get your plunger sliding properly in the barrel of the syringe That s what my dear junkie buddy the charming sexy af closeted 19 y o super twink Ryan Pratt taught me to do as a way of coping with rigs reused to the max Ryan who went to rehab out of state every 6 months like you know as the program was set up for regular relapses and detoxes in a perpetual cycle like that huh Ryan who cheated me every chance he got Ryan who if he ever went to prison would have been the most desired guy in the place over night with tough guys offerring him weed and dope left and right for his love and affection I have no doubt Yep I really should ve gone for him miserable and stupid af as he was Ryan all 120lb of him bragging about how he took a 0 5g shot last night and didn t OD Hahaha Nevermind the subtext which is if you ever even feel the tempted to fit 0 5g iof dope nto a single syringe then your dope is likely weak af it was and dirty af Lol sorry its true though he was like super hot at 5 6 120 short brown hair and nerdy glasses and whispery dope fiend voice not to mention his dead fucking laugh What a guy he was Ryan He s probably dead now anyway shame he didn t learn how to do dope from some smarter dudes There s a dude on r opiates called u captainfentanyl who literally does have a permanent IV port for drugs Dudes an opioid scientist an expert his comments are proof I know were aren t supposed to mention this but thing is I do have personal experience here I shot loads of H meth coke too to an extent And yes I ve done H and meth combined in fact that s what I dedicated today to seeing if I could appreciate how these ODs occur see I ve never ODed for whatever reason not in 10 years of doing this on and off It might be the initial rush with meth and H involves a boosting of the opioid aspect high enough that it over powers the stim effect I ve defimitely still experienced noticeable resp depression with speedballs not to dangerous level I mean so maybe it is possible idk My last shot for example 25mg meth 40mg heroin this heroin is maybe 40 50 pure that provoke a shockingly strong sedative effect I didn t move for a 10 min at the peak but yeah my level of consciousness was enough that I could simply will myself to breathe if I thought it was getting too shallow That s true but with meth and heroin as oppose to coke and heroin the opioid wears off long before the stim not vice versa just saying So that whole argument which I agree is a great theory delayed overdose can t apply to meth and amp speedballs as well as coke River had been mixing dope and coke but it s thought that some unknown 3rd drug did him in when it was added to the mix He broke down into convulsions which is definitely a sign of Stim od rather than opioid OD Well isn t more likely that a good fraction of ods are what you might call semi intentional suicides by which I mean the person likely was depressed and somewhat suicidal and they were dancing with death by taking as much as possible but they weren t necessarily set on trying to kill themselves Knowing heroin users I think this explanation is more likely in most cases people just don t give a fuck if they live or not For the record you non recreational opioid users might not know this but it isn t really quite as easy to OD even on street heroin as people make it sound I mean the precautions required to prevent OD they aren t very complicated to follow a monkey could do it but still a huge fraction of users don t have a clue harm reduction is even a thing so loads of lives are lost over basic lack of caution and it s chalked up to users just oding cause that s what they do apparently But yeah that s kind of bullshit oding shouldn t be so normalized with the proper measuring tools and precautions t s extremely easy to avoid i know people don t want to believe it but it s true Was it the high potency powder like they sell on the DN or did AFAIK Cause I got these tiny packages of the most insanely strong powder is ever seen It was so strong you could ingest just a little barely visible speck and get a moderate level fentanyl rush off of it It s a heavy and very peaceful high but it s over with so quickly in like 2 hours tops to get you back to baseline and you d get withdrawals as early as 4 hours after taking without redosing it or another opioid I ve never smoked that fent or any other fent thou honestly I suppose there is likely a system out there that could make this more viable for the moment it would not appear to be a very reliable method of administering fentanyl So I wouldn t try though I ve dntr it myself other ways I would advise you that fent is an extremely fast actually narcotic and that even taken Sublingually for example it will kick in with an onset not too far behind what you get snorting or smoking it LMAO wow that s hilarious But yes you are just realize you need to ensure that when mixing any drugs that potentiate each otherits vital start by adding in the second 2nd drug at a snails pace with breaks to let it absorb so that you can accurately determine what level of intoxication you can expect After that you can have at least some confidence that the same two drugs will potentiate each in the same way if you take them the same way For god s sake don t even think about trying to up your established safe max dose unless you have back up in the room with you with narcan handy should the worst happen Just use common sense OK It s really not that hard to avoid oding in reality not at all you can get supremely fucked up and then some before even entering the pre OD range Only dummies who dont check their dope before shooting or try to take a second massively intense shot of dope after the first one even when they already missing out In other words Don t be a part of this problem if anything please Bigotry applies to drugs as much as race gender or any other parameter and opioid related ODs are the number one excuse used by hateful assholes to justify treating addicts like sub human garbage Can you do this for me guy I know you have the smarts Promise you aren t gonna go and OD like you don t have a clue what you re doing Tell me you re gonna always take care of these things smart and do your research before making an big decisions on whether to partake and if so with how much OK Yeah this advice is spot on I know from experience In fact yesterday for only the second time in the last 365 days I scored a relatively large sack large for what I usually spent on it if and when I do which isn t so much anymore as I ve realized it isn t very cost effective compared to suboxone or kratom and thus you d likely be a fool to use it anymore than in special occasions like the one I m celebrating ATM It was some refreshingly straight dope though for real just the diamorphine with likely just one innocuous cut a plain white powder with a strongly bitter taste recognizable to me as the unique dark chocolate tang of 4 heroin the HCl salt that is Nothing to make me suspect fentanyl and I ve had no problems taking more than intended as of yet even though I ve been piling it on pretty heavily I m cautious to nit leave anything up to chance I ve got 7 years of using this stuff to various degrees on and off on my belt and I haven t had an incident yet where I required hospitalization for overdosing It cooked up nice and clear which was a relief as you really do NOT wanna have colors showing up in your injection solutions ever it always means impurities garbage you wish they d ain t subtracted from the weight of the dope they sold you so you could have totally pure heroin for once I asked my dealer for 60 worth of heroin this time As well I bought a 20 sack of some of his consistently fire ice It s been years since I ve bought that much smack in a single sack Usually I take suboxone daily which actually gives me a moderate high but since Meth comedowns can really suck and I d like to give the Meth an extended break after this anyway I figure it s be cool to have this time at least for the meth comedown which can be a butch I figured it would be nice for a change to be able to summon the Hammer of Heroin to smash any uncomfortable sensations into dust It s been so long since I ve done a year ago at least I d almost forgotten what it felt like compared to suboxone Turns out it s much the same in quality of effect but if course can be more intense in terms of the quantity of effect Anyway Good stuff Stop hating on heroin for things that are only tangentially related roheroin s actual innate properties Like understand that dirty street dope is much worse for you just for being laced with all kinds of bullshit no one asked for Understand you don t just accidentally OD if you re keeping my a tight tab on your consumption as you should Realize that you ve basically been set up to suffer all kinds of negative consequences just for liking opioids by society and those wretched self fulfilling prophecies they ll try to stick you with Like when they tell you if you use H at all you re definitely gonna die of an overdose like someone did today you have to do the right thing as I did and tell him to fuck off with the condescending fortune telling and the prophecy of doom The truth is even with the whole fent RCs situations as bad as it is you can ensure you do not OD while using heroin simply applying the proper precautions Most ODs are not really caused by insanely ovrerpowered fentadope more often than not the victim just adopts this line of reasoning without actually have a real clue what they took But rather than actually being superpowered in the legitimate sense as with something like pure lab grade fentanyl something I had the pleasure to own in minute quantity for 3 short days several years ago Yeah did I mention pure fent is very safe when volumeteically dosed Anyway OD victims are lying most of the time when they claimedm they got something resblibf pure fent in the street Personally I ve never seen anything even close to from my local drug dealer really The strongest I ve seen on the streets was a n RC opi that was about on point with pure diamorphine in terms of potency Sadly it had a few extrabside effects more itching nausea and more of a chance of triggering a headache in high doses than H The first time I did 40mg if this batch it was with a nice 20mg ice redose I had to wait for the suboxone to flush just a little bit out of my system before I could achieve that super strong opi high subs can t quite reach under any circumstances Of course I started small and worked up to gauge how strong my H was I got to say that shooting a proper speedball done as a rare treat is a really enjoyable and oddly fascinating experience I feel that it s bad reputation isn t necessarily deserved It s really not at all some inherent death trap like media won t have you think Not even close I ll admit that damn for a sec I was actually a bit scared that it was too much Id forgotten what IV heroin felt like more than I knew It turned out that the dose was actually quite safe for being so intense i had no more than trivial respiratory relaxation never lost consciousness It felt in a bizarre way almost like the Stim and the opioid together were creating like a kind of anesthetic effect as a third element on top if each of their own You feel like this vortex of dopamine fog swirls up and explodes with this spike of irresistable serenity that swallows you whole It s honestly different what from you d expect it to be in many ways My dealer hooked me up giving me 0 450g for my 60 nice considering it s 20 per 100mg for small retail samples like Id typically buy if I did at all recently before I first came back to for one night a month ago or s Anyway they trial and error I estimate that 40mg of thus dope would constitute The closest I ever came was when I once passed out in my car in a parking lot while coming home from my dealer having boy TV ht meth and this cruddy rc dope yard to say if it was fent another one it had a weird almost spicy flavor I remember and wasn t all that strong but wasn t totally weak either It was the best I could find at that MO ent relatively high purity for street at maybe 40 50 What it was is a patient committed suicide Zoloft got a black box warning for that and still got approved IDK why they didn t do the same here Frankly obesity is enough of a suicide contributor that the risk likely would have been worth it overall long term 2 3 days of relatively heavy use is the minimum The best thing you can do to prevent it is to make sure you give your body long enough to totally clear the drug after each period of use in order to start to build tolerance you need a constant level of some opioid effect to persist for 3 days straight usually Fent wears off fast so it should be easy taking mini tolerance breaks with it ,black^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,The next thing I remember is Titty pulling up to me and Barf in his blue truck about half way down Boonie s street in the middle of the night and yelling at his brother something about his girl and then skidding his tires and skirting off As he drove away I do remember seeing his gf in the car with him so I was confused Next I somehow left wherever I was and ended up back at my house which was about a 25 minute walk from Boonie s At this point I was told by my mom that I was standing in the kitchen at around midnight babbling random sentences and words to people whom I thought were standing there in the kitchen with me Apparently I still thought I was with the friends I was with earlier and I repeatedly swore to my mom that they were standing right in front of us I vaguely remember thinking cigarettes were floating in the pool in the backyard but In the morning when I checked it was only dried leaves I also remember seeing spiders crawling on the pebble ground around the pool and I shined a light on them to see them close up I remember these very vividly Black shadow like long legged spiders like a cross between a black widow and a daddy long leg According to my mom who was the only person home at the time I left at around 2am and she watched me walk to the curb outside of the house and lay down on the curb at the edge of the culdesac She was not so concerned about me because it wasn t the first time I had come home in the middle of the night super fucked up saying weird stuff so she brushed it off as me just being blacked out drunk and went back to bed Luckily I must ve been out of delirious fuel at this point and my zombified body fell asleep right at the edge of the driveway I woke up at the crack of daylight to my neighbor shaking me on the ground He was saying something along the lines of Are you ok And he had a look of surprise or distress I think I just walked away and went inside and went into my room and I may have taken a nap during this time but the next thing I remember is when my mom barges in my room and says were you with Barf last night He s in the hospital he doesn t know his name At this point I m thinking fuck what the hell and I m just trying to piece things together in my head It really felt like nothing even happened after dollar tree but then I remember walking with him to rite aid and Titty pulling up and yelling at us Then I say something like where s Titty And I run to their house which is a half a block away to find Titty and Barf s mom outside looking mean She asks me what the fuck kind of drugs we did last night I told her straight up we all took hella Benadryl and she doesn t believe me She says they just got back from the ER and the doctor pumped Barf s stomach and he seemed fine to go home But when they got home He started tripping out again I ask her where Barf is and then I hear him talking inside so I run in I ask him who the fuck are you talking to And he says Andrew which is his cousin who lives 70 miles away I calmly tell him Andrew s not here but he insists that he is sitting right in front of us all in a chair At this point his mom is freaking out and crying and I ask her where Titty is She says asleep In his room and I say something like good Then seeing that I can t handle the crying and craziness that was happening in their house I leave and walk or run back to my house frantically to see my mom waiting outside with another neighbor She s freaking out kinda because I probably look crazy and because Barf and Titty s mom is freaking out calling her still At this point I look and see my step dad s truck in the driveway and ask why he s home on a Friday and my mom and the neighbor both tell me it s Saturday Standing there in disbelief and confusion I reach for my phone in my pocket to no avail I reach in my other pocket for my wallet which is gone too Along with my mind I must ve lost all my shit also I must ve went back inside at this point when I realize I probably hadn t called my girlfriend in a really long time which was a pretty big deal back then I grabbed my house phone this was 2009 I called her and she was of course pissed that I had been ignoring her I swiftly snapped back at her and made the accusation that she had not called me whilst remembering that I still had no idea where my phone was She hung up on me and I called her back and said I ll be right there before she hung up again I quickly half skated half ran to her house almost falling multiple times and when I got there she was pissed She started crying and asked if I was cheating on her I said no and just told her I took some pills from dollar tree and got really fucked up and that Barf was in the hospital She knew all of the people we were with Thursday night and Tittys s gf Bones was a good friend of hers She wasn t really buying the story so I told her I would take her out to lunch to make up for it We decided to go to the beach first Very bad idea The Benadryl trip was yet to be over So we live near San Francisco about a 30 minute drive We smoked a blunt and drove into the city and parked near the embarcadero which is right off the bridge I took a nap on the way being still super tired and along with the weed we smoked I was starting to feel the effects of the Benadryl again We decided to take the muni transit busses and trains down to ocean beach so we got on the first train which was a really loud rackety ride Somehow during this ride I thought my cousin Alex was with us and this really freaked my gf out because she thought I was joking at first His continued except it rotated through different people from people I was with the night before to people I hadn t seen in ages I saw them IN THE FLESH right there with me on the bus I absolutely positively believed they were there and saw them with my own eyes or mind This is the most scary thing that s ever happened in my life When we got to the beach it only got worse The sounds of the crashing waves the sounds of the wind The people talking in the distance All of these sounds transmitted through the sound waves and into my brain as voices of people I knew friends family members It s like I saw them there in my mind or felt their presence without physically seeing them A very odd unmatched feeling My girl had to be super freaked out at this point and I must ve done some shit that I can t even imagine that day I only remember bits and pieces about what happened after this but I do remember that Barf and Titty s mom cut them off from me but Titty and I remained friends for a few more years Barf never forgave me Apparently he too was talking to people he thought were in his house for the remainder of the day also He never touched drugs again after this day not even weed I went on to try massive amounts of acid shrooms ketamine and dxm but nothing compares personally as far as entering another dimension or dream world for me One of the craziest drugs in the world right there on the shelf for a dollar What the fuck You probably won t die from heroin or other hard opiate withdrawal but you will want to and you will feel dead inside once you come down

0,0,0,0,None,Was it prescribed But either way it s better to obtain these drugs legally so you know what your taking is legit rather getting stuff that is cut or these pressed 30s It would be a great society if the government could completely stop access unless for severe medical issues but that isn t the case and most likely it will never ever happen We ve learned that with alcohol prohibition and the marijuana laws And I m not saying that these laws are inherently racist today but it started with an explicit bias towards black and Mexicans And the entire world followed the America s steps after these drugs became illegal look it up man And tell me why either crack epidemic so many African Americans got locked up but now with the opioid epidemic which consists mainly of white people explain why they aren t getting incarnation the same rate It because when these laws were coming in to place they knew blacks made up the urban areas where they purposely over policed Portugal s decriminalization proves that having it decriminalized is inherently safer then having it be illegal Your argument doesn t make sense Ik this probably would never happen but if the government made safe injection sites they can also have a testing facility there to test how pure your product is what the drug is and identify any kind of harmful cut in there that s what I honestly meant by legalization not just being able to walk in a gas station and say hey can I get a gram of fat china white haha But I think we re both on the same page when we want this to be a medical issue not a criminal one I obviously don t think that it should be legalized and sold with ease but they could have alternatives too that aren t as strong for example codeine is legal otc in some countries With decriminalization we could have safe injection sites like the do in Canada Instead of the government spending money on law enforcement could be used to spread education open up clubs injection sites so people can inject with someone near them to use narcan in case I m not saying that these drugs laws were inherently made to be racist but the fact is crack carried a way heavier sentence and everyone knew who was using crack Poor black Americans this was what Only 15 20 years after Jim Crow was overruled I just think that we ve been trying this method for decades now and it hasn t been working at all Again I don t mean full blown legalization but they should have lighter sentences The justice system here is fucked up man Let me give you an example that s actually really close to home with me My girlfriends mother was raped and choked beaten badly She had the whole rape kit and everything done by the book had his DNA basically everyone knew he was fucked He got a sentence of five years as long as he plead guilty Like seriously im not gonna sit here and say I know people that got locked up for selling weed and get a heavier sentence which I haven t only ever seen people get probation for that But with some harder drugs I ve heard people go 20 years 10 years etc etc way worse of a sentence then this fucking rapists got and this guy had priors he had a DUI and an assault and battery car In my opinion I don t think someone who sold trafficked drugs should ever get a sentence that s worse then rape I get that selling drugs is immoral But it s definitely in that weird grey area compared the black and white situation of rape where you know that person only had disgusting and an evil intent I think we both agree on that drugs should be a medical issue not a criminal issue of course if the person is only a user And yeah I also agree that race isn t the entire reason but the fact that it even had to do with such laws is fucked up even if it s only 10 race should ve never been a factor in this no matter how big or small Even socio economic status shouldn t be a factor deciding if a person will be spending time in a jail or if you get a good lawyer you can just get put on probation We need better public defenders better laws and more care and empathy for our citizens for going through the trrrible disease of addiction My man that was a great read I m gonna sound like a weirdo but honestly great text and use of words but I whole heartedly agree with you Prohibition was originally built off of racism with reefer madness and too this day our gov officials still think it s a great idea despite the repeated failures and not only in our country but Latin Ameirica mainly Mexico Still getting worse and worse and trafficking the highest amount of drugs then ever before The black guy that s trying to feed us daughter by selling crack by the dime bag will go to prison for years for the smallest amount But hey the CIA and our president knowingly trafficking kilos of cocaine to the USA using that money to buy sell weapons to Iran that s perfectly okay hey maybe if we commit treason with a drug charge we ll get off easier oh wait no that s not

1,1,1,1,None,People should be allowed to take drugs because its not harming anyone besides the user so its basicly a crime without victim Adults can make their own decision wheather they want to take drugs or not It doesnt even matter if drugs are illegal People make their choice either way Criminalizing people for something that shouldnt be a crime in the first place only forces users to keep their use a secret which leads to problematic consume patterns and makes people afraid to get help The black market also fuels organized crime and in some parts of the world even terrorism Drugs on the black market are also way more dangerous than they need to be Who would od on fent if drugs werent cut with it Who would od on heroin if it was the same potency everytime Making drugs illegal only creates additional problems without adressing the real problems drugs can cause People who struggle with addiction or are suffering from their drug use need help not a lawsuit People who want to roll on molly every now and then need to be educated about safer use and dosage and need to know how strong the pills are or if they even contain mdma Legalizing all drugs wont solve the problems that come with drugs But it will solve the problems caused by prohibition TlDr Legalize all drugs Chocolate is easy to make Just decarb youre bud and crush it as fine as possible Then boil some water in a big pot and put a smaller pot in the water Melt chocolate in the smaller pot Then mix youre bud with the chocolate and fill it in a mold Then just let it cool and harden out in the fridge and enjoy ,black^chocolate

1,5,1,1,None,Bah I was gonna go with that Short high and not too over the top Other than the missing redose urge it fits NEP or hex en Or there s a new one coming from China because they did ban hexen nep I wanna say ndh Kratom is what you make it Sorry this is a bit of a ramble but I liked where it went Yes it is a drug an opioid even And addiction is in every way shitty But after 5 years of daily kratom I feel it does something to treat my issues better than anything else I ve been able to find I ve been an addict for 15 years and your notion of some people needing something resonates very deeply with me Because I ve always needed something ever since I started over half my life ago Whether or not I m accurate when I say I need something is irrelevant Because even though I can maybe muster up the willpower to get by for hours days months or years at a time there s still a part of me that continually tells me the same lie you need something else Usually I can reply back No I don t This is uncomfortable but bearable and get by for the moment But the voice always comes back and I m not always so strong that I can disagree Sometimes everyone really does need something else I wish I was like the rest of them that could always stand up against that force in their head that never stops saying you need something else But I haven t got there yet and I don t think I ever will Worse than the voice is how I learned to cope with it There are many drugs that help the incessant want for more and some do so well of making you feel better that even if I sobered up to a brand new me that didn t have a want for more just the idea of not being up where that better state was would start a new and echoing voice in my head also saying get back where you were Obviously you never sober up to a new and happier self So when that voice of you need something else comes back it s a bit louder and it has more to say Now it s saying you need something else you need to get back where you were This creates a feedback loop that destroys you most always I may have been talking about drugs in this but what I just narrated is the same way all desires sound and talk Drugs just happen to be one of the loudest and most destructive desires But this can happen with anything from food sex money ect What s most important is not what desires you avoid it s how you react to desires I wish with all of myself I didn t need kratom but it s the only something so far that can keep a continuous balance in my life of hushing the always present you need something else in a way that does leave me in ruin Unlike every other drug I ve been addicted to it has a ceiling of abuse but still manages to keep me from agonizing over not having something else Yes maybe kratom isn t ideal and maybe a perfect human should get by without it but I feel it currently makes me a more functional and happier human than without it Kratom isn t free and without cost but it s worth it for me I ll keep an eye on it and adjust my use when this becomes untrue That means it s something worth buying The test isn t to get them to not buy toys It s to get them to only buy badass toys Because I don t want to play with shit toys Kids will buy any shit toy you allow them buy and I m an adult who buys this stuff Let s buy the fucking awesome toys Did you step down off a harder opioid I could probably handle a 9g dose now but 9g would ve killed me made me puke for hours back when I started Your use seems about the same as mine just a little higher I m probably 6 g doses 3 4x a day But I wasn t stepping off opioids when I started so no tolerance and my use was lower at first ,china^opioid^toys

0,0,0,0,None,Of course theres towns named after hemp in the UK and US because that was their main crop type hemp into Google Maps and there is definite evidence to show that they smoked it There has been clay pipes with cannabis resin found buried in Stratford upon Avon in England where Shakespeare lived and a more clear example in the US is that Abraham Lincoln once wrote in a letter to the head of Hohner Harmonica Company that his two favourite things are smoking a pipe of sweet hemp and playing his harmonica Basically if you can get a buzz from it people will do it no matter what period in history Cannabis has only been illegal for around a hundred years because the US government didn t like the fact that it became linked with Mexican refugees from the civil war and later with the black community It was made illegal in the UK because it was connected with West Indian immigrants and in Europe it was linked with North African immigrants It s so taboo now but smoking hemp has been a thing pretty much forever not the high THC stuff that we have today but a weaker more basic kind was smoked Cannabis is only now gaining popularity as we have found the vast medical benefits that it has The dystopian nature of this game clearly shows that the average joe doesn t make enough to live they re all dead there is very few healthy citizens but they re not exactly living in luxury I think the menu that you mention is from an era where the economy was booming and everyone had coins to spare Now the plague and the death has set in the only sure and legal way to make a living we see is joining the watch and I m sure the regency would give their guards food and a bed we see barracks and canteens for the guards in the game Their wages are very low because the economy has completely collapsed and the government can only afford very measly wages As they have no rent or food to worry about and they get all their elixir through work the guards may well spend all their money at a clean plague free bar at the end of a long week a drink is still affordable with their wage their job provides them with everything they need anyway Also the guards clearly do sell their bullets elixir and weapons on the black market the bullets that Pierre sells to corvo are the same bullets that the guards use and the gangs use the same guns and swords as the watch The economy is a bit weird in Dishonoured but set in a society literally stripped of everyone except a handful of guardsmen and rich people I think it is very justified ,black
1,1,1,1,None,I m going through a similar conundrum right now and I ve found that what I truly wanted to tone down was not drugs per se but a way of life Every day I wake up and feel an urge to change my headspace Because of habit that s generally weed or kratom A few hours later I get that urge again Nicotine or coffee Later that night I fill the void with alcohol or weed The thing is when I m taking breaks from these substances I don t stop those urges I just transfer them Suddenly I jack off more to get my fix I ll find myself glued to reddit for 45 minutes at a time I ll skip school work and watch 6 episodes of a TV show I ve already watched By getting into drugs I ve sacrificed my ability to be content While I think it s really interesting to argue back and forth about the nebulous definition of drugs I think the dividing line in this case is substances or actions that promote hedonistic behavior Discovering that was a relief for me but also very difficult Having to combat apathy and anhedonia from being sober is a lot harder if you can t treat them with drugs lol As many people say it s important to find hobbies to fill your time because within this paradigm your goal is simply to fill the void of drugs with more acts of life In answer to your question I would personally define a drug as any substance which produces a marked change in headspace whether that be black pepper and turmeric or a good bowl of Lucky Charms when you re hungry But the definition to note here is getting high and defining that is reflexive almost by nature Any sort of pleasure seeking and hedonistic behavior is reinforcing the drive to get high and so truly stepping away from a life of drugs naturally means finding more holistic ways of enjoying life That would have been ideal but I ended up meeting a friend along the way who gave me hot chocolate so it turned out alright anyways ,black^chocolate

1,1,1,1,None,Huh I m a 22 year old guy with long hair and one of my favorite outfits when I go out is black skinny jeans a white shirt and my jean jacket Fuck Maybe it s the fact that I came down about 8 hours ago and haven t slept in 30 hours but this hit me in my feels I hate using that phrase but it s how it came out Probably because I know after starting my dance with opiates and the amount of use and impulsiveness I ve been progressing to that a day like this is on its way for me at some point It has always been very clear to me that an opiate habit will eventually have to be stopped for life to progress at a certain point Really hope you re able to stick with it and put this chapter behind you For an addict to quit it has to be a selfish choice where you re getting sober for you Not for other people who want you to but because you genuinely want to be done with it and move on Hope you re able to keep a positive mindset throughout recovery and that the bad days aren t too bad and that they re far and in between No no no That s not what I meant That s just a reason where I m like ehhh about stopping I started using drugs and drinking way before I was single or wanted a relationship It s just a nice plus that it fills that void for the time being Edit after posting this I realized a better way to describe it is that having a connection with someone that I can open up to and let in would help motivate me to stop using I wouldn t want to give a significant other any information about the specific drug I m using or hide an addiction from them Even worse would be if they started using because of me I could never forgive myself if I got someone started using opiates because of me I just started outpatient rehab and got a suboxone script for this very reason My opiate habit didn t really do anything to effect my work I mean there was the time I was junk sick for a week over thanksgiving after I took Xanax on a bunch of opiates and lost a day and then I missed last Friday from being junk sick but everyone thought I was just normal sick Besides that stuff it hasn t disrupted my work or relationships and I was worried that getting clean would do more damage than using did but hopefully the suboxone will help me continue to function while I get through this phase of quitting I knew there was no way I could be responsible enough to wean myself off Hope you re able to figure something out to help get through this part too One of the other comments made me face the fact that I ve become physically dependent on opiates and the second half of this comment really helped motivate me to come clean to my parents about my use and start an outpatient rehab program I go back tomorrow to get a suboxone script assuming that s what it will be but it could be another one I m not sure yet to get through the withdrawal phase of quitting Thanks man 6 months of regular opiate use is long enough How moderately I generally take 225mg of Benadryl and 30mg of cetirizine spread out during a 12 hour high so I don t have to deal with just how intense the fucking itch gets for me Is it riskier to take it with another antihistamine plus morphine and etc opiates in a dose similar to the size of the other antihistamines I really only take this stuff for the itch so if it s not better for itching than the others I ll probably never mix it I d google this shit but I mean google just says don t take any antihistamines with opiates so what do they know ,black^opiate^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Those kids look like they are high on fentanyl in the picture Look at how big they are smiling while they go to town on the opiate itch Another inaccuracy that I see repeated hundreds of times here bupe does not rip oxy or heroin or anything else off your opioid receptors An oxy molecule binds to you receptor for less than 1 second then releases and recirculates to either be metabolized or bind again A bupe molecule binds to your receptor for an average of 40 minutes After which it also releases to recirculate and either reattach or get metabolized So it s not that bupe is ripping oxy off your receptors it s that bupe is occupying your receptors so that oxy can not attach due to both the length of time that bupe stays attached and it s higher binding affinity than oxy or any other full agonist opioids In most any other context I would agree with you but dope dealers and opioid dealers in particular tend to be slimy pieces of shit with zero respect for anyone else s time My guy does not a real job he does have kids but does not have custody and he still makes customers wait hours and jump through hoops to meet him and get product I truly believe many dealers are sadistic bastards who enjoy and fully exercise the power that the addictiveness of their product gives them I wish to high heaven that I lived in an area where gangs controlled the drug game It s a business to those guys phone is turned on 9am 9pm everyday somebody answers every time and you have your product within 30 minutes often less of making the call every time When you re the only white dude in a 100 black neighborhood washing a 20 year old Lexus on rims it s obvious what you are doing and why you are there Course IDK Maybe it s all just in my head I met good people and have good times in the hood too We recently met this parrot Polly on the streets of Mumbai while working on a new documentary featuring opioid addiction amongst India s bird population He has a prosthetic leg because he fell asleep in an awkward position while high on opium and had to have his leg amputated due to compartment syndrome The painkillers given to him in the hospital for his amputation surgery only served to fuel his addiction If anything being an amputee has made his main income source from panhandling more profitable because of peoples sympathy for his disabled condition This parrot must earn at least 200 per day just to stay well and avoid withdrawals We asked the parrot why he didn t just quit Polly is a smacker is all he replied We then offered to buy him lunch but he said that lunch hour is the most profitable time of day for panhandling Polly bummed a cigarette from a crew member and then shuffled off to stand at a busy intersection with his cardboard sign If you or any parrot you know is suffering from opioid addiction please call the national parrot substance abuse hotline toll free at 1 800 357 9538 i work at a very prestigious private high school I had a student walk in on me once as I was face down on my desk snooting a roxie Also once had my boss walk in on me 5 seconds after I snooted a roxie and still had several more crushed up in plain sight on my desk Never heard a word about it Other than an occasional bout of opiate rage I d say my addiction has had an extremely positive influence on my job performance Everyone knows how opioids enable you to energetically work long hours Minor injury getting 120 blues a month No fucking way The DEA requires specific IDC s to justify opioid prescriptions for patients A doctor who prescribes 3600mg a month of oxy for ICD s for minor injuries is going to be investigated by the DEA sooner rather than later The answer you re looking for oxy The answer you re not looking for this is the worst possible idea you could come up The opioid high is only a temporary escape You chase that feeling repeatedly and soon you are psychologically and physically dependent Then you spend all your money on the drug and after that you probably resort to doing illegal things to get money You finally realize you have a problem and try to detox at home but you can t because the withdrawals are horrible so you go to rehab Once you sober up in rehab you realize the problems that you first tried to escape are still there only now they are 100x worse So you relapse to escape again and the cycle starts all over You waste years of your life cycling through rehabs and long periods of using drugs punctuated by shitty stints of sobriety Maybe one day you get clean for good maybe not This is called addiction and it s almost a guarantee outcome if you go down this path Please reconsider Yep I am a mid 30 s guy who looks perfectly healthy from the outside but I get sixty 10mg hydros a month due to some chronic pain issues I have been looked down upon by pharmacists and pharmacy techs many times Once I even had a fucking pharmacy tech openly question my need for the medication Are you fucking kidding me A pharmacy TECH is making medical decisions The stigma surrounding even legitimate opioid users in the USA is sickening That s what happens when the male human orgasms for the first time after a 6 month opiate binge There is no source he s full of shit The neurological changes induced by chronic opioid use are 100 reversible with sufficient abstinence and that includes methadone

1,1,1,1,None,Thanks I m going to kick the kratom as soon as I ve hit the month mark because from what I ve read that s when withdrawals subside and I m left with paws When I was sober for a spell I was using about an oz of kratom per day and phenibut sporadically at first but ended up bad off on it for about two years My SO said I was just replacing addictions with the kratom jumped off and was left with a bad phenibut habit which I totally replaced with phase 2 of my opioid addiction which included the hard shit but I had a well paying job at that time until I went down the spiral losing that job legal trouble and my kids and their mom Point being gabagerics scare me my first love were bars and alcohol when I switched to phenibut the withdrawals were probably the worst I ve had until I kicked this done But I do get where you re coming from I m trying to get on suboxone and just taper down once I m through the thick of this while setting up a sober foundation and such It s a red state through and through Also I don t feel like opiates are on the level they re at on the east coast so help is scarce unless you re insured The USA in general hates the poor I d say you either die a stoner get clean or progress to opiates That is the natural order ,opioid^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,When I got tired of smoking weed everyday I started doing opiates every day It was great For the first month And then it ruined my entire life So don t do that Congrats But a strong painkiller Lol I thought tramadol was a weak opiate It never did anything to me I def get higher on low dose hydro and even kratom than tramadol But everyone is different Good job Just the usual replacing my dad s and grandma loratbs with Tylenol Stealing tar from roommate who introduced me opiates He wasn t even mad lol pawning a guitar my mom got for Xmas Making up stories why I needed money Couple times took 40 out the cash register at work Never got caught tho Thank god ive been over that addiction for a couple years Subs were the first opiate I got hooked on So personally i don t count it as clean time for myself But everybody has a different definition Clean time is when I m not dependent on an opiate Yeah that was my story And I said bupe was the first opiate I got dependent on But I had experience with oxy 30s and hydro 10s beforehand I was well on my way to addiction but found out about bupe from a roommate that was prescribed and overall enjoyed it more because I had a low tolerance the half life was way longer and it was cheaper But I agree with it being hard to abuse bupe and get high Yet it happens all the time For instance my aunt was suggested to go on suboxone from her doctor when she was coming off 40mg hydrocodone And it ruined her life even more Bupe is a lot stronger than hydro and after 8 months on bupe she decided to taper and quit And the bupe wds made her want to die she said Eyy hell ya Congrats on the week clean from roxis Roxi 30 was one of the first opiates I tried and quickly moved to bupe I just have one question about your reply You start out saying I agree for your case since you were hooked to bupe For most people though that s not the case could you clarify that Because I believe majority of people on bupe are hooked to it and have a dependence in which they will have to go through withdrawals of they decide to quit I was no different Yet my dose was low to moderate Before I got it prescribed from doctor I would just take 2 mg every other day But i agree with what you say Bupe has been a miracle for a plethora of people Personally I don t think it was beneficial for to be on long term Do you have a plan on how long you d like to stay on em I didn t mean to suggest your clean time as not real if ur on MAT I just meant for me personally My clean date will start when I m off all opiates Proud of u tho I remeber seeing your posts 180 days ago Hmm I drink probably 5 nights a week on average But usually only 2 to 3 IPAs and ive never noticed that I take kratom 3 times every day aswell It May be that I just casually drink the beers after work over the course of like 3 hours So I never really get drunk I wouldn t think the kratom would cancel or weaken the beer When I was on hard opiates alchohal made the opiate euphoria stronger Ya I m still on it Been like 14 months When i got off fent heroin i was doing about 30 gpd Which is a lot But not so much for people coming off hard opiates I didn t feel the kratom for at least a week Now I am on 10 gpd and overall life is great Soon I will finish my taper But with tramadol it should def work bc it is a fairly weak opioid and the kratom will help with the serotonin properties trams produce Damn when i do opiates i get very social do tasks ive been putting off or can just chill Its like am upper and downer at the same time for me Methadone for a single relapse after months clean That methadone may as well tingle those receptors in a control way and send him off to the races OP I wouldn t suggest getting on methadone unless you feel you have zero control and will die Or if you don t want to me sober and be a synthetic opioid for a While Either toss that shit or try and dilute it some way Or sell it You don t need that shit Glad I haven t gone through that in a couple years On kratom now And sometimes when im off I ll purposely not dose for like 20 hours so I can experience wd and see how bad it actually is While its no where near traditional opiates It is pretty shitty My eyes water up the same amount mild restless and lower back pain Have never gone more than a day without So I assume i wouldn t sleep much without it Trying to keep tapering down and hopefully jump soon I had a drug for a pretty good job last week I haven t done hard opiates in a couple years but just do kratom beer and weed I got the phone call last week and had 6 days to get the weed out of my system The operating manager called me this morning saying i passed and offered me the job and i start Wednesday My secret is to just go in there after diluting my pee but not too much because the test could come up invalid But drink a decent amount of water Gatorade beforehand Make sure you pee at least 4 or 5 times during the day before the test Take a couple b complex vitamims to give my urine a yellow tint instead of it being clear And take some creatine like 4 hours before so my creatine levels seem normal Out of the 5 or 6 drug tests in my life ive never failed and usually had smoked 5 10 days before test May just be my metabolism and the fact i only smoke 3 or 4 times a week though Good job on wanting to kick your addiction It will only get worse with time You are likely to get a variety of answers on your question I cant tell you an absolute but can give my experience A couple times I used lope to combat early wds It works Not a godsend but it does help Dont take massive doses that some say they do It is not neccesary Don t take it more than a week First day id take like 10 15 pills so 20 30mg Then work my way down to none over the course of the week You don t have to take it a week either If a couple days past and you feel ready to stop then do so The 2nd day id take like 8 pills Then 6 4 2 Will it prolong the wds from those doses and length Probably not Maybe slightly Like the runs will come back obviously And you may feel restless But that would still be the case even if you didn t take lope Lope gets a bad rep and sometimes rightfully so bc ppl take huge doses for months and get hooked on it I hear wds are not fun and super long bc of the half life I think it is a useful drug to get clean in the right doses You won t feel 100 better Maybe like 50 better Everyone is different Even when i took it I ll still felt somewhat sick But my opiate usage was a lil higher than yours I was still detoxing my body while on the lope so it was beneficiary for me Hope this helps Also to note For some it takes a little while to get in the body So the first dose on day 1 i was always frustrated So id take another small dose like 6 more pills to load up And by day 2 I would feel a lot better and could tell it s working It is pretty benign as long as you dont exceed the 20 30mg range Good luck Nice Cuban girls sexy are hell Couple months ago this girl nearly bruised me with her boney hips lol Not enough cushion for the pushin Ive lost too many girls to opiates and am still single with no kids at 29 Opiates are the only drug to make me choose it rather than a life with a beautiful girl Yea i have to take 40mg for good euphoria with a pretty low tolerance Oxy hits me better and other stronger opiates obviously Oxy doesn t come up opiates I could have swore my parents tested me and i failed for roxis back in the day Oh I understand Wish I would have tried that couple years ago lol But just remember what you are fighting for Things could get a lot worse quick Continue your taper and stay positive I know a couple nurses who use kratom That may be an option for you as you finish your taper and would help with cravings Especially in early sobreighty While it does have its own addiction potential and wds They are a cake walk compared to methadone and other harder opiates It really helped me Wow sorry man Use this as a cross roads in your life With opiates things will get a lot lot worse Trust me Shit basically ruined my life Even though I just take a little Kratom now Long term opiate usage made my mental health a lot worse and im Still repairing relationships and my life financially Best of luck I know Everybody has different backgrounds and experience Yet it s rare for someone to be content and happy with there life as am opiate addict Not neccesary talking Bout pain patients on a low to moderate dose of pills every month yet i see a lot of posts from them as well I never stole or became homeless cor anything like that Never shot up But it ruined my potential and affected my life negatively It ain t easy being addicted to hard opiates without it affecting your life But I guess Its possible for some Yeah ive been on kratom for awhile now And obviously its lost that euphoria But back when i used traditional opiates It would give me the feeling i described Yet that s where addiction and dependence come in And it ain t worth it Thanks for the reply I realize 180mg on methadone is rare But I saw it numerous times at meetings when i got out of rehab But I insure you I know what its like getting off heroin fent and get onto mat drugs I know you dont get high I did it dozens of times But my point was i didn t truly get happy off those drugs and didn t classify it as clean Being on mat long term has it s negatives as well as positives It helped millions of people im sure But just because it helps you doesn t mean you are clean Everybody is different It negatively effected my life in the long term But i appreciate you replying Im sorry if i came off as stuck up and conceited People told me im worthless and should burn in he ll because i think being clean is being off all synthetic and natural opiates ,opiates^opiate^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Please understand what I meant by the post Don t compare opiates withdrawal to alcohol ghb withdrawal Nobody dies from opiate withdrawal in a hospital just sometimes in prisons because of dehydration It just doesn t increase brain activity seizures blood pressure and bpm to lethal levels like alcohol ghb Withdrawal does And benzo WD to a lesser extent I know ill probably get hospitalised My ghb is running low and I m unable to get new stuff I want the doctors to actually immediately treat me by sort of leading them into diagnosing me with severe dangerous withdrawals If I straight up tell them what s up they wont treat me until it s too late I already damaged my blood vessels last time I quit because of it GABAergics withdrawals are known to be more severe esp delirium tremens after the first time I think I ll die ,opiate
3,0,0,0,None,Hey everyone So I just posted my feature film online because it didn t get into any festivals and I didn t want it sitting on my hard drive any longer I made it with 11 friends over college winter break 30 days I m of course sad it didn t get in anywhere but I m proud of the film I didn t go to a name film school or anything like that my school had one production course and almost everyone on set was learning their role for the first time I ve never done anything as big as this film was I have 7 other shorts and let me tell you it s exhausting A typical day for me was getting up at 3am shoveling cars out of the snow and then filming until around 10pm clearing cards backing up footage etc until about 12am and then setting the alarm for 3am again The story was a bit of a personal one for me about the opioid crisis that is currently happening in the US right now I really wanted to show the main character James as an addict that we don t normally see in television film Not a monster but an actual human looking for something to latch on to I hope at least one of you gets a chance to check it out and I m always open for critique no matter how big or how small Thank you ,opioid

3,1,1,1,None,Uhhh what Exactly where did you read that the White House was warned about the opioid epidemic So I ve been trying to get off and stay off heroin for years I stopped in April of 2019 and started ketamine infusions in May I picked up again in November and stopped in December about four weeks later But honestly from April to November that seven months was the longest clean time I ve ever had Your mileage may vary I guess Addiction is fucking hard I run an opiates recovery discord server https discord gg dC9MaKs it s not very big but it s a great place to discuss pretty much anything if you need someone to talk to or just listen Please feel free to join us if you ever feel like it I feel similar a lot of the time I wish I had an answer for you When I m really depressed I get so upset that I m an addict that I ll always be that way and I feel useless and hopeless What do you like to do What is it that when you do it you re in the moment For me it s music and singing and performing in general And I m half way decent at it It feels amazing better than drugs ever could I took some steps to start doing that a little bit every day Singing in the car more listening to music I love instead of turning on the TV picking up an instrument again and not judging myself for how bad I am at it Since I ve started doing this and it s only been maybe ten days I ve felt miles better about myself I m not just a heroin user I m a person with hobbies and dreams I ve been depressed since I was a child I ve been on antidepressants and other psychiatric meds since I was ten or eleven years old I ve been in therapy for that long too I ve tried so many different treatments for my depression and sometimes they work for a little bit It may be placebo effect eventually I find myself depressed again and not willing to keep throwing money at my problem Sometimes I just resign myself to the fact that I ll always be this way and I should just accept that I ll always feel miserable I ve been doing ketamine treatments since mid May of last year In the beginning it really worked I really did improve But as time went on well here s my mood monitor chart http imgur com a ex3ORUn The black lines are infusions I had an infusion two weeks ago and two weeks prior to that and I m currently in the moderately severe category of depression according to the PHQ 9 I don t know if I need another one or if I need to give it a break and keep waiting I m not currently suicidal I was three weeks ago so I guess I got that going for me And at 500 a pop I m not sure I can keep affording it Especially since I just lost my job My mom has been very gracious in helping me out lately with the cost but of course there s a lot of shame and guilt that goes along with that I know everyone just wants me to be better but at some point I have to give up and accept my fate right I don t know I guess my point is that you re not alone I don t know what to do next either I ve tried TMS I have not tried ECT but my memory is already shitty and I don t want to make that worse Plus ECT seems scary I started a discord server for opiates recovery coming up on three years ago I wanna say Something like that Lots of people stop in when they need to vent and leave when they re doing better but some people stick around for a while You can build some neat relationships with people you get to know very well inwardly but might not be able to recognize in public If you or anyone else ever wants to check it out the link is in the sidebar of this subreddit Hey I have treatment resistant major depression generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder I m in my late twenties and I ve been on psychiatric meds since I was eleven I feel you on the life long mental illness Often I feel like I use when my level of self loathing reaches a height and I feel trapped and unable to cope I m not using opiates or hard drugs at all but I m smoking weed and a couple weeks ago I had some ciders I m not really drinking because alcohol makes me feel nauseous lately So like I feel like I can empathize somewhat If you wanna talk I m always on discord and my PMs are open hell I d be okay giving you my number Definitely talk about how you feel It helps ,opioid^opiates^dreams^black

0,1,1,1,None,Well I live in Switzerland not Sweden it is a great country indeed Switzerland is right next to Germany Docs are less hesitant compared to the U S to prescribe opiates as far as I have seen Treatment is available There still is a stigma over it yeah and Fent hit the streets already lucky us to be shocked by it But if you re willing to make sure you get real pharma pillies and are willing to pay the little extra compared to shit fent containing pressies you can get clean shit Again not as bad as you guys have it I read an article few days ago that swiss docs tend to prescribe opioids 2 8 times more than 10 years ago hence a lot of pharma available rn although voices are becoming loud being concerned with the epidemic so that may have an impact on what s available in the next 2 5 years ,opiates

4,1,1,1,None,Opiates are derived directly from or by processing the opium poppy or Papaver somniferum They are part of a larger class of drugs called opioids which are generally drugs that operate on the opioid receptors in the brain 60 mg of 2 MAP237 felt like a hydro with no tolerance but with a bit more mental euphoria It has decent legs more so than some of your more traditional Opioid RCs but less than say O DSMT ,opium^opioid
0,1,1,1,None,I have a similar background The answer is taper Kratom is legal and cheap Are you going to say you dont have the will power or self controll to taper If so ask yourself does it take more willpower to taper or to CT I tried CT and realized it takes more willpower for me to get past day 2 and 3 just like the heroin wds I went thru for ten years I couldn t taper heroin the high was too euphoric and irresistible But Kratom isnt You can do it But if you really feel you cant taper give your stash to someone who will distribute it to you and be accountable for you Drop one gram over your dosing per week Stick to it there wont be as painful Smoke 24 cigs a day if you smoke 23 a day for thre next 4 days your body and mind wont feel it Apply this concept to your kratom all the way down You can do this if you really want to do this painlessly Remember how bad opiate wd week is Why pay that concenquence for kratom we didnt get the good highs like H but at the end the concenquence is the same but doesn t have to be Taper you can do this And what sucks is the lack of transparency in this documentary is working against the movement WebMD says kratom is as dangerous as fentanyl That is ridiculous of course It makes them look blindly stupid or in denial This documentary says its not addictive Ok so if for some it s not So is that what everyone is to expect Of course not that s not what is common People if you really believe it s not addictive Head over to quittingkratom forum the 10s of thousands of people all there must be just lying or so dumb it s the symptoms they had before it 4 to 6 days of insomnia diarrhea restless leg syndrome obsessive cravings for anything to make it stop temperary depression anxiety attacksx etc now does that happen to everyone no of course not but dont you think it should be included doesnt it make them look deceptive Hiding what can be found google search from any forum after forum of physical dependence that is definitely not anything like caffine withdrawal Ffs Be in denial folks maybe you dont have these issues but thousands and thousands do Yet it s not mentioned hmmmm I take it 3x daily and all for it STAYING legal But I don t need to leave out pretty important facts about it to convince someone it s good That s the wrong way going about it Imagine you re gonna vote about this issue you know nothing about it you see the documentary so you re intrigued Then you google or reddit or see the detox centers of people going thru Hell not for for all but SOME and then wouldn t you wonder to yourself why they left that out I d see it as deceptive and assume it must be bad and vote it down Since when is something on fucking TELEVISION more creditable than thousands and thousands of people s experiences Stop being a blind sheep like webmd is as well Be 100 transparent if ya want it to remain legal I mean alcohol causes physical depndance and is addicting and people get outta control on it That doesn t mean we lie about it to keep it legal And it has NO medical value or saves you from ANYTHING So many pros outweigh the cons anyhow Like you can t OD no cns depression its cheap easy to make So much more going for it than prescription opiates We dont need to hide the truth or lie to get it pushed thru It s a magical thing in itself P S edited for typos sorry Thank you for humbly coming to my TedxTalk folks Careful on your journey home It is a state of mind to an extent BUTA there are PHYSICAL changes The physical changes are what make it a disease by definition unfortunately When opiates gaba drugs xanax ex are used in excess or longterm it Actually changes the brain The frontal cortex is responsible for reasoning common sense and process thinking Once physically dependent and addicted the frontal cortex activity depletes to almost no activity and your fight or flight gland hypothalamus gland takes over When you re without the drug the hypothalamus triggers adrenaline and the fight or flight response a panic compulsing you to get more Literally you struggle and do things that would harm yourself to get your drug of choice Reasoning and common sense is out the door At that point it literally isnt willpower anymore You re unable to think properly because of the PHYSICAL change This reason is the only reason the medical field has accepted it as a disease And it s why insurance companies will pay 40 000 dollars for a month of treatment If it weren t classed as a disease it would have to come out of your pocket so this is a scientific fact that is a GOODZ THING It s why people now have empathy for addicts They can get ya off the drugs But only GOD can fix the physical brain change that has happened Your disease The efficiency potency to the receptors Higher affinity the quicker and the higher the tolerance will build Meaning a mean ass withdrawal Like phenibut has a crazy affinity For most 3 or 4 days in a row withdrawal syndrome happens Most narcotics take weeks to months or even years for some For this to happen Xanax causes a pretty quick tolerance and dependence not just because of the affinity at the receptor site but also because of the short half life Drugs with short half lifes cause a quick rapid withdrawal like say 4 to 6 days but it s a profound withdrawal Where as drugs like suboxone have a huge half life 48 to 72 hrs which still causes a withdrawal but usually for most not as violent of an withdrawal but it will last longer like 2 to 3 weeks of it Heroin withdrawal is crazy violent when I went thru it for like 4 to 5 days When I withdrawald from suboxone it wasnt as bad for me but lasted for almost a month Heroin high affinity at opiate receptors with a 6 to 8 hour half life where suboxone is less efficient compared to heroin BUT the half life is 48 to 72 hours vs 8 hour half life like heroin Hope that all makes sense Sorry I m withdrawing as we speak from kratom lol On the 3 day no sleep yet since last dose ugh why do I do this to myself Krstom got me off heroin but now I wd from it It s no different feeling accept I feel I got ripped off because i didn t get the blissful highs like heroin gave but I m still paying for it now Edited for typos FUK It is possible I know this isnt relative to you but when I went thru oxy withdrawal perc 30s I used meth for 4 days if it past the peak then after just had insomnia of course And an hour or two of restlessness for 3 or 4 days at night once the lights were out and trying to sleep Which I m sure some of that was the meth comedown But even tho meth doesnt hit the opiate receptor and obviously not cocaine but the high from the meth I believe was just more intense than the withdrawls from the oxy I was at the end of the oxy taper I had done over 3 weeks 2 years clean in March First time I ever injected coke I started shaking uncontrollably Freaked me the fuck out Like a seizure but completely alert and awake for it Ironically it didn t scare me away Instead I started cooking down crack in a spoon added a little vinegar and or vitamin C to break it down and make it injectable since it s not water soluable like powder Is then I d injected it 5 dollar feels like 20 dollars of blow With no grinding of the teeth But the come up on it was insane Totally flooded with sweat instantly feeling like yore in a pizza oven That I OD d on for sure I kept injecting crack then started mixing my heroin in with it for one injection together I know right fucking idiot right I remember hearing the ringing in my ears then everything went black Next thing I woke up to someone doing CPR on my chest trying to pump my heart Never ever ever did that again Never touched cocaine again and that s when I started my 2 yr battle to get off H Of course people new to it have a hard on for the documentary since its the only one of it kind with at least SOME info on it But big factors have been left out If I were one of the people that go thru bad withdrawals and based my use on that documentary alone I d be fucking pissed and my hard on would be at wanting to get it banned We dont need people backsliding that are for it in the 1st place then later feel deceived In my state alone just under 3 000 overdose deaths due to opiates that ARE NOT KRATOM Kratom has less than 100 known accusations of related deaths Mostly with other drugs involved So there is their example of blind faith on the opposing side as well This documentary should be called Leaf of Blind Faith It needs redone maybe when they made it they were clueless as to this But I don t think so Re do the documentary put in all facts The truth shall set you Free Let s keep it legalized folks The post was so long I guess adding the past opiate history wouldn t of made it much worse I have to be honest I am 2 yrs clean off an opiate addiction of 10yrs With opiates I have major issues Had gabapentin Rx and klonopin Rx for years never had issues with them off and on thru the Dr They were lower dose A few times I took a few extra klonopin but it just made me sleep too much felt best st 5mg But opiates are another story a nightmare for me I m in my 40s now I guess being scared of another nightmare again I stay humble Then after a week the ten dollars worth does nothing Then ya need 20 And so on then 100 dollars does nothing So then ya agree to inject it even tho ya promise yourself you d never do that after the 1st injection 10 bucks feels like 200 dollars worth snorted so it feels like injecting is the answer to being able to afford it Then you guessed it a week later 10 dollars IV d wontdo it Then ya inject 20 and a week later etc Then before ya know it ya dont even get high or any pleasure from it and chasing it daily is just to stave off withdrawals just to feel normal and able to function Then after some time doing it if ya get a kidney stone or something requiring pain meds in the hospital they won t touch the pain Your tolerance gets so high the amount of pain meds ya need to get rid of the pain they wont give that much afraid you will OD Even after almost a year of no opiates it s like I have permanent tolerance What would make someone almost OD doesnt even touch my pain After all this I look back with nothing but regret I know you were oy asking about doing it once But realize this EVERY heroin addict only intended on trying it and never thought they would get to the point they d inject its madness the insanity of it is insane Actually now you say it when I use phenibut I smoke cigarettes like a mad man I bet it is related to gaba agonists maybe same when I drink But ya right on my buddy told me he took gabapentin for a week once and he claimed it was like xanax WD but not quite as severe I was scared to stop taking my phenibut I m with you sort of on enjoyment of gaba substances I do not enjoy the high at all I took 1 5grams once of phenibut and did not enjoy it whatsoever Gave me a bad headache and remember the veins in my temples looked as thick as the ones in my forearm I think it s why I haven t chased the dosage up higher and higher One day I take 500mgs the next I might take 1 2grams Never been over 1 2 and never been under 500mgs I find that is the right dose I get the calming effects from without making me feel like I want to sleep and no need for caffine at this dose I look back and have no days where I think to myself that it s not working or need to take more I think it s from not taking set doses each day I ve never taken the same dose two days in a row It always fluctuates daily Kratom and opiates on the other hand I have to taper taper taper and still WD some when I stop I dont get it ,opiate^opiates^black

0,0,0,0,None,Maybe in the US Canada But in Europe no one would be prescribed opiates for having teeth removed you d be told to take Ibuprofen and paracetamol The max you d get is some 8mg codeine paracetamol pills I know it activates them but once it binds to the receptors it blocks other classic opiates from binding Sort of like buprenorphine Even before the opioid crisis you wouldn t get more than ibuprofen in the UK especially for a 13 yr old Maybe some co codamol if it s bad I just take 2 capsules a day Really helps with stress and anxiety for me It has even been shown to reverse damage to neurones caused by stress It also reduces cortisol levels But basically I noticed my tolerance wasn t increasing very fast compared to what I d heard and I looked into it I found a study showing that the spine density of dopamine receptors remained the same when using ashwagandha with opiates Simply put Normally when you continuously take opiates the amount of dopamine receptors decreases and they become down regulated meaning they are less sensitive to dopamine so require more of it for the same response This is a big part of what leads to tolerance so ashwagandha really aids in slowing this down and maintaining tolerance I made a post about it if you wanna take a look You can also google ashwagandha and opiates and the study should show up although it s quite technical Edit I d highly recommend using KSM 66 ashwagandha as it has the highest concentration of withanolides which are what contribute to reduced stress and maintaining tolerance Ashwagandha has been proven to help prevent tolerance build up from opiates It prevents down regulation of dopamine receptors in the spine ,opiates^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Oh shit yeah the brain zaps are a real thing actually usually associated with getting off of SSRIs I was on Zoloft for like a month so that I could eventually get on klonopin and when I got off I had the brain zaps It s a weird sensation for sure And with opiates I feel more like my brain is constricting during WDs and my skin is crawling Seizures form stopping opiates Shit that scares me now Does that happen or is it because of all of the crazy fent analogues now assuming the pills OP is getting now might be pressed Another thing to add is to try exercising I know everything in your body and mind is telling you it s impossible but just try to force yourself to run or bike Perhaps even lift some weights if you re near a gym so your restless muscles have something to do I just cut from 4 to 2mg once daily and while WDs have only been mild I ve been forcing myself to run 35 minutes after work and alternate arm and leg days as well because I get RLS and restless arms I m Also taking magnesium glycinate Hope that helps Edit will also produce natural endorphins natural opiates in the brain You WILL feel better after I promise you won t regret it I had success with Linzess but it s not specifically for opioid induced constipation It s a prescription and I don t believe there s a generic yet Of course my insurance no longer covers it tho so I ve just been taking magnesium Someone said burn in hell Jeez people take this sub too seriously sometimes I take your post as what it is an opinion yours for a sub that promotes honest discourse about this type of stuff The worst thing that could ever happen is for this place to become a complete echo chamber I am on subs and consider myself clean I guess because I m not seeing a dealer everyday spending all of my money lying to people and basically ruining my life HOWEVER I m not myself again yet not 100 anyways It has served its purpose for me at this point and your line about not progressing in your career and continuing to isolate while on it resonated with me I hate being on subs now every day is like a 5 10 I m still tired a lot But they likely saved my life earlier on in my recovery I ve been tapering but the upcoming WDs I ll inevitably have to deal with are scaring the shit outta me My point is I wish I had just gotten this over with early on and dealt with just the H withdrawals but back then I wouldn t have been in the mental place to stop yet So it s a double edged sword Subs helped me get the clean life so that my thinking could finally change enough to be able to handle these upcoming WDs without turning to dope I m ready now but it took years It s going to be difficult but I know the payoff of never needing ANY type of opiate when I wake up to feel normal will be so worth it Lots of good advice in these comments It s true that it s always a matter of when not if and once you realize or experience how scary things can get it s much easier to finally stop Sure being on opiates is an amazing feeling and so was the rush but thinking I can keep this up forever has zero logic behind it I seriously thought at one point that the party never had to be over Otherwise if you know you ll have to stop someday anyways why not stop now I definitely clench my teeth day and night when I start to withdraw definitely gives me those temple headaches Unrelated to hypertension but still a headache related to opiate use nonetheless This is so weird I was diagnosed with hypothyroid with nodules too RIGHT after I quit and got on suboxone I started gaining weight rapidly more so than the normal getting clean weight and was diagnosed like 6 months later There s no history of it in my family or anything else I know it s common but I seriously think it s linked to opiate use somehow or maybe even suboxone I was only a user for a couple of years I wish there were more studies on this idk I know opiates can be tough on the endocrine system but I doubt tons of legitimate pain patients who take prescriptions regularly have these sorts of thyroid issues Otherwise we d be hearing about it on top of all of the other opiate lawsuits and whatnot going on right now Interested to hear if you know of any studies or even something anecdotal related to this Agreed I hate when people say that on the news articles and or even movies shows when they try to cover portray the opioid epidemic Like no that barely scratches the surface and is not why people get stuck in this cycle for years It s the mental torture Trainspotting is the only thing that comes to mind as far as getting it right and capturing that aspect accurately In that movie even after the WDs are done Renton is bored unmotivated not feeling like himself right before he ODs while on methadone Agreed that mental torture is the absolute worst part which is why I hate when people who have never used opiates or gone through withdrawal act like it s the exact same thing as the flu Sure the physical symptoms are similar runny nose and sneezing GI issues etc but I ve never had a flu that s completely mentally debilitated me People don t keep using because they re afraid of getting the flu for 4 7 days We they keep using because they re afraid of the mental hell that comes next and fucking lingers well after the physical WDs are gone So yes for me it s the mental part plus the restless legs and sometimes arms that kept me up all night and resulted in no sleep for days on end Also the weird brain fuzzyness that also feels like my head is like constricting the pressure on it sometimes Idk hard to explain but I m sure you know what I m talking about Lack of motivation is awful I ll throw that in with the mental torture Then second comes all of the weird smells and genital tingling Haha My hair thinned about a year after going on suboxone which coincided with being diagnosed with hypothyroid Once I got on levothyroxine for a while and switched to head shoulders it got better I also take biotin now but it got better before that For me it was less of a side effect and more related to hypothyroid I ve seen other women saying they were diagnosed after going on subs too It could be subs or opioid addiction or something else idk But opiates are definitely hard on the endocrine system It s so weird because I ve seen other people saying stuff like this about opiates in general but have never found anything about it agreed w subs too Yeah I never got sick sick on heroin either It s weird some people chock it up to the lack of socialization during addiction and isolating yourself more therefore you don t get sick But on Suboxone we re back out in the world working seeing friends and family again etc I only very recently got a mild sore throat thing but it was manageable and I didn t miss any work Everyone else seemed to be getting sick and I finally caught it once I dropped my sub dose to 4MG lol ,opiates^opioid^opiate

but it was still a great experience That was our first original song we all pretty much created it together I think that band is now reduced to a solo project of just the singer and his guitar tracks I don t follow it honestly I m more focused on recording my own music now and practicing technique and playing with more emotion You re welcome I love sharing things that have helped me with others seeking help Psychedelics have changed my life for the better too The good quality Whole Nutmeg I use has a similar level of psychedelic activity as middle shelf cannabis which personally is perfect for me Nutmeg s psychedelic properties give me a good mood lift feelings of mild euphoria and lasting well being a more POSITIVE WORLDVIEW and kindling for creative inspiration Sometimes I get teary from my heart opening on nutmeg like a psychedelic spiritual cleansing I experience all these different effects on different levels with different amounts of nutmeg 1 2g is perfect for work 7 15g is great for events like going to a themepark a movie a night out a long trip or even just a lazy stoney day at home playing video games I LOVE how it lasts all fucking day and takes care of me until my head hits the pillow I think these tiny doses work well on me because I grate my nutmeg nuts To answer your question on the 25 gram dose Did you grate or grind your original 15g dose You do not need to ingest more nutmeg for a stoning effect 15 grams should be way stronger for you than before if you GRATE the nuts What brand of Nutmeg do you use it s possible your nutmeg may just be low quality ingesting more will not help that You need to get a grater or at least smash them and put them in a coffee grinder Turn the nuts into powder in some way because there is more surface area exposing nutmeg s special active oils making it totally more effective Wash back with cold water and enjoy On 6 grams of nutmeg and a little black coffee 4 hours after dosing I see shimmering on striped surfaces like vents and window blinds and I can even see faint patterns dancing between the grooves and LOTS of motion tracers and mild colorful static in a mild stoned haze During this I ll feel happy and calm maybe even feel giddy or excited if I m doing something normal like grocery shopping or cooking at home The whole experience is enjoyable especially with headphones To answer your question about serotonin depletion I think too much nutmeg too often is not healthy for your brain or your body Doses like 1 4 grams daily is not bad at all But 10 grams every day for over a week is too much I get mentally and physically slow from doing too much of it like that I get perfect results using nutmeg every other day or 4 days on 1 day off repeat 5 days on 1 day off is pushing it Too much nutmeg too often will not help depression it will make you feel tired If you find your sweet spot with nutmeg dosage intervals and caffeine you are set for life I m currently 14 hours into 3 grams of grated nutmeg as of now Only 3 grams I feel a nice tingle in my head body and legs I also have the munchies I felt a little irritated at work today but I was definitely not miserable I was able to be friendly with customers and co workers and work hard through my shift without hating life and that s all I could ask for For work I combine Nutmeg with tiny doses of Kratom and L Theanine as well I hope my freakishly long reply helps you Ask me anything else if you need clarity on this Stay away from Preground Nutmeg It s not medicine like Whole Nutmeg For Whole Nutmeg nuts don t just eat them Either grate the nuts with a fine small holes cheese grater and wash parachute back with water Or smash the nuts then grind the smashed nuts in an electric coffee grinder and then parachute the powder harder to swallow than grated nuts You could mix your grated or grinded nutmeg nuts in oatmeal or applesauce but that honestly makes me gag especially with any amount above 2 grams of nutmeg For me it s easiest to just grate the nuts by hand weigh the dose and wash back with cold water little by little No gagging no problems I ll sit down and grate up to 80 grams of nutmeg in one sitting for a month s worth of dosing so I don t have to do it every day Oh shit I just remembered my NUTMEG RECIPES Sometimes I ll get cookie dough from the store and infuse the cookie dough with nutmeg by putting one section of dough one cookie s worth of dough at a time in a pot on low heat with a tiny smidge of butter and 4 7 grams of grated nutmeg I ll mix the dough and nutmeg together with a wooden spoon by rolling and kneading it together in the pot The butter helps the nutmeg powder stick to the cookie dough Once the dough collects the 4 7 grams of nutmeg powder I place the dough on the baking sheet to be baked Bake to desired texture whether you prefer mooshy cookies crispy cookies or right in between With chocolate chip the flavor is WONDERFUL when dipped in BLACK COFFEE That is the ultimate morning ritual Nutmeg cookie dipped in black coffee I called them Space Cookies An EASIER recipe is to mix your desired amount of grated grinded Nutmeg powder with PEANUT BUTTER Put some regular butter in a pan or pot and mix your nutmeg powder with your preferred amount of peanut butter Add sugar to taste This one is ADDICTIVE You can put it in a sandwich with jelly or just eat it with a spoon haha I loved this one Sorry I got carried away Liver problems I ve been taking nutmeg regularly for almost 3 years and I ve had NO KNOWN liver complications I used to take 19 grams of nutmeg 4 5 days a week Then I noticed that 8 12 grams of nutmeg felt easier on my body Then lowered down to 5 8 grams regularly By now I take 2 3 grams of nutmeg 4 days a week simply because the lower doses are very effective on me now If I ever get liver complications I will post on it Until then this stuff is honestly as harmless as weed if used responsibly If you drink lots of alcohol or smoke lots of cigarettes or eat lots of junk food nutmeg may be a bad combo for you I don t do any of these things and get wonderful effects from whole nutmeg Sorry for the long post I love this medicine I had a dream of a familiar person doing something to my spine I was telling them stop hurting my back that hurts stop it and then waking up still feeling that terrible spinal pain for about 10 to 20 seconds still saying stop hurting my back That was a weird one x200B Had something exactly the same happen to my manly parts too That one hurt really bad and I still felt it when I woke up x200B Yes I feel excruciating pain in my dreams too Thank you so much for your awesome honest response It must be a true blessing to know workers of these medicines that can brew it for you and guide you through the complex worlds the medicine can take you to I think my question of combining these two plants of power comes from my personal longing and coveting of Ayahuasca I bet she will kick my ass for this when I finally meet her I ve tried brewing it at least 5 times and failed each time I did this with gentle singing prayers and wholesome intentions the best I could A reliable Ayahuasca recipe is a subject for another thread and there s already TONS of threads on it Good ones too To be fair once on an attempted Aya brew I briefly floated through a space star tunnel with closed eyes and later saw a perfect circle in black darkness and the circle led to a place with blue skies and tan desert mountains and the circle was framed by a series of small benevolent eyes I wanted to go there but it was too distant This was with Chacruna diplopterys cabrerana and Caapi I combined Chacruna Chaliponga and Caapi once and it did nothing but clear my digestive system I was hoping the Mimosa Hostilis would work better since I ve read tons of experiences using this ingredient with wonderful results If there s anything else you would like to share on the subject please feel free to It s no problem ask away YES I say Kratom is in fact a stimulant because 1 I cannot sleep after consuming kratom Red Sumatra is said to be the most relaxing and pain killing strain and I could not sleep until it wore off I was laying awake going through all these social scenarios goals memories just thought after thought At that time I think I drank a 1 gram tea of that Red Sumatra Someone close to me who tried kratom for pain relief at night had trouble sleeping too 2 The outdoor laborers in the SouthEast Asian islands and countries Thailand Malaysia Indonesia etc this is where Kratom and Nutmeg come from love Kratom and drink it throughout the day It relieves them of their tiredness and gives them energy to do intense physical labor all day They pronounce it kruh TOM and they chew the leaves 1 3 leaves per dose for them I m sure some people can sleep on kratom but I cannot I m more of a stoner never an opiate user other than kratom so that might have something to do with it s effect on me Kava is more of a downer I usually drink Kava on days off and nutmeg breaks Here is one thread on the essential oil posted by 69ron You can easily find more threads on Nutmeg essential oil by simply googling nutmeg essential oil forum and you ll run into plenty of reading material and experiences https www tapatalk com groups herbsmxf nutmeg oil a far better psychedelic than nutmeg nu t3619726 html But the way 69ron doses his oil in capsules is just weird to me Here s an easier way to dose the oil I get a cookie Any cookie Like chips ahoy or something I measure 1ml don t over do it by using my measuring spoons Using the 1 4 teaspoon one quarter teaspoon I fill that spoon flat with nutmeg essential oil using a dropper that comes with the oil and dump it onto the cookie The cookie is necessary because the oil soaks into the cookie surface and will not be lost Goes down easier on chocolate chip cookies too 1ml is enough 2ml was pretty strong and made me giggly while at work which is a bit too much Was reminding me of my mild acid trips I don t need to be mildly tripping and giggling at nothing while serving the public lol The effect of the essential oil on 1ml is less stoney and more focused and stimulating than regular nutmeg The stimulating effect literally gets stronger and stronger over a course of 12 hours like regular nutmeg I always have my caffeine with this too and I seem to be more jittery under the effect of nutmeg essential oil I generally feel happier on it too and work harder I stress that it s pretty stimulating So if you plan to get to sleep at 9pm at night you need to dose this essential oil around 7am that morning It may still be pretty stimulating past 9pm that night It can keep you awake past midnight easy When I need to sleep I d pop a Melatonin and just lay as still as I can to get to sleep I m sorry that all this is so complicated and long lol It s one thing after another Please be careful and do lots of reading if you even think about trying any of this stuff I m willing to go into more detail on any of this if you want ,black^dreams^opiate^chocolate

1,1,1,1,None,I love benzo s and opiates In my experience benzo s can fuck your life up just as badly if not worse They lower your inhibitions to the point where you would do things without giving a fuck about the consequences at all Especially when blacked out I don t know why but Opiates don t seem to have any effect on my bowels Maybe because of my IBS I love opiates They re my favourite class of drugs but for some reason they make me extremely irritable Like when someone drops a cup or burps for example it pisses me off so much Opioids do numb my emotions but I just can t figure out why they make me so much more irritable than usual I m asking you because I ve made so many posts about this but no one has answered my question as yet and you re the only one on the post so far that seems to have extensive knowledge and some experience with opiates I just prefer the word opiate to opioid because I m a lazy fuck and I don t want to enunciate the oi But wouldn t opiates opioids have to act on opioid receptors to be considered so regardless or their chemical similarities I m not sure if DXM acts on these receptors I occasionally dream of doing heroin but the only opiate I ve ever gotten high off of was codeine Lol I don t do codeine because it s cool I do it to self medicate when I m in pain or depressed otherwise I take it recreationally I ve been getting high off of it since I was 12 and even then I never took it because of some dumb trend or to look cool I never even knew people commonly abused it then People who do drugs because they think that it s cool are making a huge and easily preventable mistake Especially when it comes to opiates in regard to it s addiction potential I m being hypocritical because abusing drugs recreationally is also stupid Yet people who smoke or drink alcohol don t get criticised almost nearly as much as elicit drug users You have 30mg pills I ve been getting high off of codeine since I was 12 and it only takes 20mg after a week long tolerance break on an empty stomach for me to get a light nod I d say take 4 or 5 if it s your first time doing codeine since you might not realize you re high as you aren t familiar with the feeling and it s a fairly weak opiate Yeah I know benzos and opiates are a dangerous combo but I would ve definitely OD d with that much codeine on it s own I wouldn t have taken that dose if I didn t black out on the benzo s 90 pounds That s fucking ridiculous I m South African and there s a brand that costs around 1 pound per bottle We don t even need a prescription for codeine it s OTC It s probably because lean is nowhere nearly as praised here as it is in the US or the UK We do have a problem with opiates and lean is fairly popular amongst teenagers but it s not an epidemic I really fucking hope codeine doesn t become prescription only here Withdrawals will fucking kill me along with my chronic pain I took zopiclone because I was extremely depressed I blacked out and I was meant to take 300mg because my back was fucking killing me and I had a cluster headache I knew that a regular dose wouldn t relieve the pain because I have a high codeine tolerance I lost my inhibitions on the zopiclone and I took double the dose instead I went to my room and I immediately knew that I took too much I layed on my bed and tried to stay awake while forcing my self to breathe at the same time I felt better after a few minutes after I threw up I never would have done this if I were sober I know how deadly CNS depressants and opiates are I feel much better now I just feel like puking every now and then The codeine atleast managed to get rid of the headache and backache Feel like it never happened After this experience I definitely won t do this shit again Tramadol can get you high Not all people can get high from it as different people process it differently Tramadol is a fairly weak opioid and is about the same strength as codeine Prolonged use could cause serotonin syndrome This can also happen if you combine it with SSRI s I personally prefer codeine I can t get high off tramadol at all You should not exceed 400mg per day as there is a seizure risk above that dose I don t know how it will feel compared to oxy as I ve never taken oxy before nor have I gotten high off of trams It s only ever potentiated codeine for me I asked a similar quesrion a few days ago Most people commented that they both feel pretty much the same Both codeine and heroin are metabolised into morphine I think that one thing that definitely can t be compared between the two is the rush Heroin is converted into 6 MAM giving the user an intense rush that can t be compared to many other opiates Other than that I think that the feeling such as the emotional numbing warmth and the type of euphoria that you get would feel the same at some point during both highs Oh fuck you guys need a script for codeine That s the dumbest shit I ve ever heard I wouldn t be surprised if people move to dope to treat chronic pain just because they can t get OTC codeine How about poppies What if you grow them and extract the opium or make poppy seed tea I think it s legal to grow a certain amount of opium poppies but it s illegal to extract the opium I don t see how you would get caught if you grow it in your own garden where no one else can see It s extremely addictive though Idk how the fuck anyone would be able to workout on opiates When I m on them I couldn t give a fuck about anything besides laying down and enjoying my high ,opiates^opiate^opioid^opium

1,1,1,1,None,you may have already been activating opioid receptors too much on a daily basis as an alcoholic the addictive pleasure of alcohol is apparently caused by the indirect downstream mu receptor activation anyway that s the eventual fate of everyone in this game i have decided to get out after massive doses of iv fent no longer gets me high just sleepy and withdrawal relief cough syrup is supremely abusable i used to chug that stuff an opiate is an opiate is an opiate yet another physician in pain management at that who is ignorant of opioid pharmacology or perhaps he s aware and just shitting his pants from the DEA breathing down his neck and is okay with throwing patients under the bus to save his own skin sublocade pro maintenance on an opioid helps mood if you re depressed or anxious con still dependent on opioids possible feeling of highness withdrawal at beginning and end of dose respectively vivitrol pro no longer dependent on opioids con possible blockade of endogenous opioids overdose risk after missing a dose Oh boy You sound just like me I was so miserable and opiates fixed things It became an all consuming passion keeping my supply steady and finding new sources It s like falling in love you only think about this one thing You can do it and honestly you may get a good couple of years but ultimately you ll be no better off in terms of mental health and almost certainly other aspects of your life will suffer unfortunately meth and other stimulant addiction is harder to treat than opioid addiction cause there s no obvious way to satisfy the craving without triggering a high i think things extended release ritalin have been tried with some success but nowhere close to as successful as methadone or bupe for opioid addiction there s a special place in hell for people who profit off of the suffering of others with bogus treatments years of opioid addiction has given me a notably flabbier and rounder physique than that guy and i doubt i need to worry about having a girlfriend let alone a nosy blonde girlfriend anytime soon any junkies here actually stay in shape hell if i m already destroying my body with junk staying in shape is just not a priority just to be clear if you don t have some tolerance you have no business messing with fent even with substantial tolerance to other opioids 150 ug of iv fent felt very strong at first for comparison a dose that an opioid naive person would receive at say a colonoscopy would be like 25 ug happy birthday anyway after nearly a lifetime of being taught to delay gratification opiates allowed me to do the exact opposite instant gratification in a needle unfortunately i feel like it s over i go through a week or more of brutal withdrawals for a day or two of pleasure it s just not worth it i have tried pyschodelics as a phd student i was with an organic friend from the lab next door and he had taken full advantage of his lab s supplies so to speak to make a gram of psilocybin i must have done way too much cause it was terrifying though very illuminating and revealing of my long term fears i ve tried one of every major class of drugs and they were all worthwhile experiences but only opioids made me feel like this is how i always wanted to feel alas it does not last ,opioid^opiate^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Acid completely fucks my body All kinds of pain One of my few bad trips I felt literally like a cockroach being sprayed with raid and my whole body was super painful and tense and just felt horrible Shrooms make me feel drunk and give an amazing body high better than alcohol If anything they relieve my back pain Shrooms to me feel like drunken tripping almost Last time I was stumbling around with noodle legs and it felt like gravity turned sideways and I was literally hanging on to doorways for support tryna walk around my house as if a black hole was trying to suck me into the sky And it was so fun and felt amazing 7g but I think they were weaker than some I ve had Opium dens seem so cozy lol I agree I d love to visit the middle east and India for several reasons but finding a traditional opium den is one of them Just be warned that right now due to Apollon s exit scam everything is being fucking DDOSed rn and its super hard to load most markets and forums Yesterday was fine today I barely managed to send the vendor a message Perfect thanks and I m in Colorado so I m very familiar with concentrates so that gives me a good idea I might buy a gram of regular and a gram of the shireh I wish it was more popular too I ll never do heroin or fent I once broke my leg and had two big ass bottles of hydrocodone and oxycodone Never once did I take more than the prescribed dose in fact I halved it due to side effects like cold chills Opium contains morphine yes and codeine and thebaine which has miniscule effect But it is much safer than taking pure morphine and way more safe than heroin I d think I mean it stands to reason that as something is made more potent it may also be more dangerous More side effects stronger high stronger withdrawals and therefore easier addiction and overdose It s ALMOST like weed vs all the synthetic cannabinoids I am aware that noids are full agonists and thc is only partial whereas morphine is the same both in opium and isolated I don t see why modern medicine didn t just stick with opium and morphine instead of developing stronger and more addictive drugs that are worse than opium I mean opium addicts are typically very functional compared to addicts of its derivatives even those who smoke 12 grams a day according to this https journals sagepub com doi abs 10 1177 002204267900900209 journalCode joda Yes I heard of red rock incense This is a reputable seller who advertises to Europe but I asked and they are willing to ship to US They have Shireh and regular Yeah I didn t think fent at all but besides itchiness drowsiness and euphoria idk the effects of opiates He was possibly nodding off but he is very drug naive and he didn t really get when I tried to ask him if he had been He definitely zoned out and left reality for long periods possibly nodding off and said at times he felt like he was losing himself I live in Colorado and smoke legal weed every day Unfortunately I wasn t with him and he is in an illegal state If the black is just substrate and not something growing then I as a noob currently still waiting for my first jars to finish colonizing think it looks fine Obviously Just say no Doesn t work but discouraging someone from future exploration in opiates who has just read about the people here suffering addiction might actually influence them as does the opposite If ya wanna get high smoke some weed Don t move on to harder shit and weed will suit you just fine If you go and get yourself an addiction to opiates then yeah weed may feel like a shitty high That would be my advice Opiates and benzos are better off used medicinally and never recreationally And I was saying how about stay away from opiates in the first place and never have to resort to immodium because it IS worse for you physically than percs yet its not what will hook you I have immediate family who moved on to heroin after stealing some of my percs when I broke my leg in high school God Bless Baltimore What the fuck goes through people s heads who say shit like this Like yeah anyone who does this recreationally is a dumbass but how the fuck are you gonna follow that up with take a few percs When taking a few percs is what eventually leads people to using a shitty horrible substance like loperamide for withdrawal Moreover he admitted to being a dumbass Probably a fucking teenager who just wanted to try some lean What the fuck You tried an OTC drug to get high because you don t have any connects We use that for withdrawal here Go get addicted to REAL opiates and then you can come here and post about using loperamide dangerously and stupidly the RIGHT way I hope you were kidding when you said take a few percs If so downvote and ignore me Yeah that sounds like laudanum which is a really old medicine made of opium dissolved in alcohol Or it could be paregoric which is camphorated rather than alcohol Where tf and when did you find laudanum Especially in an original bottle like that You must be older than me Like an opium vape cart I see those Or like laudanum Easy to make Or do you mean a smokeable form of opium that is thick and syripy but a liquid Thanks I m definitely thinking I ll end up using a dab rig for it Might try hot kniving once just to feel old school I m actually reading that codeine can t be smoked and opium has codeine so taking a slightly bigger dose orally works better and much longer than smoking I ll test both I ll have it probably late February or early march hopefully I plan to make a post about it Very nice to know I think you can still buy pods online but they are hard to find And I ve also heard of poppy seed tea but many places are now selling only washed seeds I see you are correct about the different cultivars of poppies actually being all papaver somniferum None of the other species of poppy except possibly papaver orientale could have been what they were after looking it up I do know that many opium dealers over centuries have bred poppies that produce higher amounts of active alkaloids in the opium but all papaver somniferum have a good enough amount This is definitely a plan for the future however my space is way too limited currently I got the idea after doing some lawn work for a woman with poppies I think they were bread seed poppies not papaver somniferum yet they still bled latex that tasted like opium is described when smokex and may have had a very very slight effect She wanted me to cut them down but it was like the last thing she wanted me to finish so I scraped them then the next day collected the latex and took the heads home after cutting them down when I finished This experience made me really wanna try real opium largely for the taste alone It was delicious in a floral choclatey incensey kinda way Yeah see this is what I expected and thank you for confirming it This falls in line with experience reports on erowid except for ones that just say a bowl is the amount smoked and don t even mention how many bowls they get out of a gram It seems entirely unreasonable that I d need 2 grams for smoking I ve heard of hotkniving and I could also try a dab rig I guess I will probably try both smoking and eating small amounts They also have a stronger form called shireh which I understand to be filtered opium pipe resin The vendor has been pretty fast to answer my questions but there may be a slight language barrier it seems Yeah lol thanks so much I ll watch that now I didn t think of trying to find videos or documentaries since I m very text based but that is probably my best bet I live in Colorado so I already have a dab rig might try that I ve heard of them for heroin but wasm t sure if opium would leave behind more residue

1,1,1,1,None,Somebody is selling eightballs or quarters or ounces to these guys with the 10 sacks Meet that guy Craigslist is also a good bet Black roofing tar and clear sealant are hot items I ve dealt with this too when I was copping on the street Someone is out there you just have to look real hard The first time I smoked meth was the best experience I ve had with drugs Maybe the best experience I ve had ever It felt like my life was exactly what it should be even though I was homeless Even having a history with opiates I had never felt my inner state go from fucked up and sad to absolutely ideal like it did after my second or third hit It s never been quite the same Doesn t feel as warm and safe as a strong opiate though I ve never gotten a sense of complete relief from all my problems from weed If that s not what you re looking for in a drug or if weed really does it for you in that way lucky you Didn t have a scale One time I bought a piece of black for 40 that was bigger than I would expect at least half a gram but cut to complete trash I was shooting like 06 at the time to get high Got as much as I could in the rig did the shot and woke up a couple hours later The other time I eyeballed it out of my homies 8ball but wanted to leave enough for him and got the same effect Even if I did weigh it out the lethal dose you ll read about is the LD50 which means the dose that will kill over 50 of people There s still a good chance you ll live if you go over It s not an exact science There is not a drug strong enough that we should withhold harm reduction in the name of not condoning it I don t need people on the internet to validate my drug use and tell me it s okay to keep using None of these kids who are about to start using meth or heroin are going to have second thoughts and stop because you berate and dismiss them It s not like we don t know that they destroy people s lives and the kids who come in here convinced that they aren t going to get addicted to a super addictive drug because of how well they handle weed and alcohol and molly and coke or whatever get to have that belief because they think they re invincible despite all the warnings and how badly it goes for a lot of people There s nothing you can do to change their mind That s not what they re here for Granted it s sometimes hard to advise people on how to do things safely If someone wants to know how to inject heroin without suffering health consequences we can tell them how to sanitize and hit a vein so they won t get an infection but we can t tell them how not to get into the depraved unhealthy lifestyles that a lot of people engage in after that It s worth noting that for a lot of people basic self care falls out the window pretty quickly after certain lines are crossed But that s not a reason to scold instead of giving support Some people think it s not worth teaching any harm reduction because drugs are categorically too dangerous to see any shades of gray One day it s marijuana the next day you re boofing an entire bottle of codeine syrup and the next day you ve got a permanent IV bag that you just drop heroin into all day Best to avoid it altogether so we re going to lie about marijuana being super dangerous Again if people heeded every warning they got it would save lots of lives but the warning sounds like bullshit so we use drugs anyway we just don t get any actual education on how to do things safely and reduce harm If someone has a friend who uses meth or opiates or whatever who s life isn t in the shitter you lose your credibility when you say those drugs are too risky and must be avoided at all cost There are also those who are depressed enough that they don t care and the ranting is lost on them too If all you have to say about someone trying a drug is that they shouldn t do it and they re an idiot for even asking you re not helping If I used those I d have to turn down most of the heroin I can get access to Good idea for Xanax users or anyone else who doesn t want a surprise opiate in their drugs though ,black^opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,I ve never understood how lean got so much hype around it Codeine literally the shittiest opiate to ever be put on the market and promethazine anti histamine they give you for a tummy ache Yes kratom is great depending on quality most of the time smoke shops carry some pretty bunk shit but I just recently picked up some very good quality red Borneo from a local smoke shop and it s a god send for these wd s I ve been taking kratom daily for probably 2 years now I used it to quit my opioid habit I had and just never stopped but I did switch to some really low quality shit about a year ago just because it was what was available in my immediate area But now that I m going through the benzo withdrawals idk if I could do it without having found this quality kratom And once you get totally over the benzo wd s just cold turkey the kratom you ll see people say it s hard to stop but it s really not man if you can get off of benzos then putting kratom down cold turkey is a walk in the park a little runny nose and RLS for like 3 days and then you re as good as new I ve cold turkey d off of 25g a day for months straight of quality kratom and it wasn t even close to as bad as the withdrawal you get from a quick benzo taper Bro you ever tried a benzo Or hell even a muscle relaxer Not that I recommend benzos they re the only thing more evil than opiates But antihistamines are OTC for a reason They don t fuck you up Promethazine is RX only but I m not really sure why it s no more sedating than doxylamine which is an OTC antihistamine Well tramadol is an opioid not an opiate I m unfortunately one of those people whose bodies metabolizes opioids very poorly so I ve never felt any effects from tramadol even at crazy doses and the only effects I ve ever gotten from codeine were hives and extreme itching I rate both drugs 0 10 well codeine 2 10 cause it literally just gives me an allergic reaction But still the point remains lean is dumb Pop some Percocet with some hydroxyzine and then you re on mega lean lol it s just a garbage drug that got hyped up through rap But seriously it seems like atleast one rapper who has tried lean and literally any other opioid would come out and be like yo lean aint shit try poppin like 2 percs and see for yourself Do a cold water extraction on your Percocet hydrocodone if you plan on taking more than 4 The acetaminophen in these pills are actually more toxic than the opioids and if you re using Percocet hydrocodone to get high you re much more likely to OD on the acetaminophen than the opioid I ll be honest I ve never done this because I m reckless and don t want to waste any of my drugs since I have a super high tolerance so I can t remember the exact method but it s very simple and you can just google CWE and find your step by step instructions Also I don t IV but for all those people out there that do Use a micron filter every time Yeah man and I see people recommending people benzos for opioid withdrawal all the time and it s just the absolute worst advice If you got addicted to opioids chances are you ll get addicted to the benzos you re using to kick the dope You can quit dope through sheer will power a lot of will power and it s definitely tough but it s nothing like benzo withdrawal it takes a lot more than will power to kick benzos Glad you got off the oxy tho man and I wish you luck in kicking the benzo habit I m currently on a taper using diclazepam because I m one of the idiots who got himself an RC benzo addiction and it s fucking tough I wouldn t wish it on anyone but now that you re in it just make sure you see your way through to the end man A life without any substance dependence truly is great I had it for about a year and it was awesome then relapsed and I m back in shitsville Do it man Don t expect the kratom to completely nullify your opioid withdrawal because it s not going to do that but it will help a ton and with the right mindset it will make getting off the opioids 100x easier I used it for the very same reason it s still going to be hard man so the most important thing is your mindset and your will to get clean don t expect it to be easy and then say fuck it and get back on the hard stuff You re life is going to be so much better if you get through this man I hope you re able to do it I have an insanely high opiate natural tolerance I could take 200mg of oxy in one go and go to work or eat dinner with my family and no one could even notice Turns out there s some rare gene in some people with red hair red facial hair that causes this however opioids do still work on me I just need 10x what the average person needs Maybe there is a similar gene that affects acts the same way but with benzos rather than opioids and maybe you have it Again not recommending it but if you like promethazine with opiates literally any benzo with opiates will blow your mind ,opiate^opioid^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Junky Jesus did help me get it all haha I love having a good selection so what we got here Around the outside A bunch of 12mcg h and 25mcg h fent patches on the left One of each 5mcg h and 10mcg h Buprenorphine patch Four 8mg Suboxone buprenorphine A bag of 100mg and 300mg gabapentin not an opi they are for potentiating my doses In the top part 3 15mg mL liquid IV IM SC Morphine solution 100 1mg Dilaudids 3 2mg dilly orange pills In the little container with the green lid 5 more 2mg dilly and a 2mg clonazepam emergency container lol The 2 white pills are 8mg Dillys In the container not all are counted from top to bottom and left to right 37 5mg 325mg tramadol APAP Ultracet 10x 100mg Tramadol ER Next 2 slots are Baclofen a Muscle relaxer that has good synergy at low doses and I find it helps me sleep Next row 2mg Loperamide imodium I believe it potentates opiates but I know it synergizes with alot and when taken in a higher dose with codeine can get you pretty high In the same compartment 3x 25mg Xanax and 3x 15mg tampazepam I will assume you know how benzos work with opiates 10x 5mg Percs The pink ones are all the same 25mg Diphenhydramine an antihistamine potentiates opiates good for getting rid of the itches when taken an hour or more before your dose ot can help get you alot high imo and depending on the opiate Orange pills in the bottom are 5mg clonazepam another benzo And a point of coke in the green baggie for a rainy day lol I have heard of people baking oxys in the oven at low temps until its like a light sandy brown color and that is one method to making extended release into instant release Also I have heard of people putting crushed up oxys in coke pepsi over night and it makes it instant release and they just drink it and get a good buzz I also feel like if you working try and make it a Freebase kind of like what they do with crack that might work too but instead of sodium bicarbonate baking soda i believe you are supposed to use just sodium carbonate with opiates I assume doing something like that would get rid of the extended release I m sorry if I didn t get a chance to reply to you on my other post yet but all of that support was so amazing and I was really fucked up last night been sleeping most of today but I had to say thank you this is a wonderful community we need a world of wonderful people like this If you want to know what anything is just ask away I know I got a couple non opiates Tonight I got another free point of Coke and traded buddy in need a 25mcg patch and threw is some clonazepam for 2 more 8mg dillys they were soooo damn good never had em before and damn I was wrecked last night With no tolerance to opiates at do not sniff more than a bump the size of a match head if ot could be fent then you could still OD So real oxycodone works really good if you eat it 90 bioavailability meaning if you take half a 30 your body would absorb most of the 15mg which if it is oxycodone will get you high or should if you sniff it the Bioavailability is like 60 so you should get higher eating real oxycodone Fentanyl when eaten is 10 Bioavailability but Fentanyl when sniffed is 85 Bioavailability So from what I ve heard buddy was buying presses with 1 2mg of fent 10 of 6 is 06mg which can get you sort of high I assume because you have no tolerance but sniffed at 85 of 6mg is like 5mg absorbed and you will OD and probably die especially without alot of immediate narcans Damn eh yea it takes alot of research sometimes but that voltaren stuff should be good for aches while you re feeling sick Its real name is loperamide Immodium is the brand name and is actually sold as diarrhea medication it is a derivative of demerol I believe It does bind to your brains opiates receptors but so slightly that you can t get high off it it will make you sleepy and it definitely help if you are experiencing withdrawals but it can also help if you are legitimately sick too lol You sound like you re sick but it could be a little WDs too they will make eachother worse My advice is to get loperamide imodium because it is a opioid derivative take like 4mg to start and benadryl DPH and lots of apple juice and water because they will make you constipated Get yourself a night time sleepy tea or a tea that has passion flower in it passionflower being a natural sedative Hope you feel better Papaver somniferum is the only type that produces opium you can only tell by the latin names Check out r druggardening Yes absolutely They are very different actually I can t explain it like a professional but I can explain it to the best of my ability which is pretty good imo Oxycodone is primarily synthesized from Thebaine which is a dissociative type opiate naturally found in opium like codeine and morphine this actually gives oxy a more stimulating effect than most other opiods Hydromorphone is made from morphine in a similar way to heroin from what I understand however due to its unique nature it is very fast acting and sedating hydromorph is actually twice as strong as heroin per mg however it is not nearly as euphoric and very short lasting by comparison Oxy is very euphoric and longer lasting while providing excellent pain relief it is more stimulating than sedating Hydromorph provides a stronger sedated pain relief that can cause euphoria and in my opinion is better for nodding and hydromorph has a unique intense rush to it because of its ability to pass the blood brain barrier quicker so when you inject it or boof it and even sometimes when sniffing for the first time it provides an amazing intensely euphoric rush that lasts minutes while you come up on the drug untill it reaches proper levels in your system and then you have a short lasting sedating euphoria afterwards Also bioavailability affects how you should take these to get the most out of then individually If you are interested in learning for about drugs and stuff check out The Drug Classroom on youtube he explains how alot of opiates work and their differences in very easy to understand ways sometimes it gets a little sciencey but it is normally understandable Hope this helps a bit I don t suggest moving to stronger opiates however for safety reasons I would recommend codeine or hydrocodone if a 300 400mg dose of codeine doesn t get you feeling good you probably have a poor opiate metabolism Also doses like that of codeine could give you stomach cramps and stuff so be prepared and definitely take a non drowsy ginger based gravol What I recommend for most people with tramadol is to use potentiators that way you can take less but stillget a great buzz also I believe Tramadol has a ceiling dose meaning after a certain mg your body can t do anything with it like for example codeines ceiling is like 400mgs To get a better buzz you could take 25 75 mgs of Diphenhydramine benadryl or 250 500mL of pure Grapefruit juice an hour before dosing it will help your liver produce more CYP2D6 which helps the body break down opiods helping the effect last longer and be stronger over all which means you can take less and still achieve the same high Perscriptions like Pregabalin or Gabapentin can do wonders in helping potentiate because of the pain relief effects and synergy with opiates Also I have found Passion flower teas or bed time herbal teas found at the pharmacy most often do the for me at night to really get sleep can make the hour before bed a nod fest and a half I just like to wish people caution with Tramadol because of the seizure factor even tho it is a very low probability I warn more because I leanred that Tramadol is very different from normal opiods and can have alot of different affects on the brain I like to help people learn there are lots of different tips and tricks we can do to safely enjoy our buzz better and make our product last longer I myself love tramadol as well it has a wonderful euphoria and great affects for me I deff have the Tramadol Gene haha Have fun and stay safe sleepy sibling I boof morphine all the time 20mg first time will overwhelm you and make you sick especially being opiate naive I think that even just doing 10mg could overwhelm you You can always take more but never less and boofing is so much stronger than sniffing or eating it Here is a link to a guide on boofing and a bioavailability

idea trying to find out info before hand going to new clinics can be very intimidating I really hope you get the info you re looking for But I think your post is going to get band soon for adding a location no locations is a rule to keep the sub safe but in a situation like this it is kind of needed so that we can help you better maybe you can try the opiate recovery subreddit they might be able to help too No one gets clean over night if you have a slip dont let it pull you right under again Do not beat yourself up People slip up We are only human and we all struggle but no one deserves to

on yourself addiction can happen to anyone but you are getting help Which is more than alot of people can say In Canada we get melatonin over the counter and I was told by multiple sources that it it s quite helpful for opiate insomnia because melatonin is natural in your body anyways I couldn t imagine it hurting but then again I do know that Tramadol affects brain chemistry a little different If you can t get a good answer on here I would suggest downloading a texting calling app just so you can feel safe and remain anonymous call the pharmacy and ask to speak with a pharmacist most will be very willing to help Good luck I did word my first sentence weirdly because i was high so Im going to edit it because yes that is exactly what I ment it inhibits CYP2D6 which is the one of the main

1,1,1,1,None,Let me reiterate a bit So this isn t something I believe myself or rather really never thought about it I have always not believed a lot of the hype about addiction and always felt one can use and recover fine but just recently I was in the hospital non opioid related illness and the doctor started talking to me about suboxone I told him I would really only be interested in using suboxone to get through withdrawal and then stop taking it to avoid then having to taper off that He then went on to tell me essentially I have to be on one or the other suboxone or dope otherwise I will not feel pleasure and likely relapse I just hate the idea of trading one for the other quiting dope to go on subs If I get clean I want to be CLEAN and allow my body to begin getting used to having nothing So ya I guess the doctor scared me a bit but I wanted to know if there is any truth to that I mean sometimes when I haven t used in like 24 hour I already start to feel my senses and perception changing in the sense that things feel familiar like they did before I started using So if I can feel that way with just 24 hours off drugs I d imagine weeks months years would do wonders but from the conversation I had with the doctor he essentially is saying no The doctor is saying I would need suboxone to essentially assist me back into life Is this true or can I really just get off and start healing right away ,opioid
1,1,1,1,None,I only just recently realized that my 13 year relationship with opioids was the same as every other I got hurt and the doctors just kept handing them out story I had only taken opiates once before I was in a car accident in 2004 It was only soft tissue injuries and while it DID hurt it didn t hurt nearly as much as I kept telling them But what never hit home was that at some point the doctors have a responsibility to say No The closest they came was saying You know they don t recommend opiates for people that develop a tolerance so quickly And then they wrote the next script In less than a year I was prescribed 120mg of Oxycontin with Percocet on top I ve been told not even most cancer patients take this much But all I could think of was how I lied to and manipulated the doctors not seeing that I was just part of the Great New American Tragedy I wish all doctors would be as conservative with opiates as my recent surgeon I had a wrist fracture that required a 4 hour surgery to put a plate in When the surgeon gave me my prescription for 4 days worth of low dose opiates he said Don t even ask for more I won t do it ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,I have my methods that make it super easy The base colour of my hair is predominately white The darker your hair the less vibrant the results Henna does not open your cuticle to lighten your natural base colour There is no damage You cannot remove henna once it binds to the keratin in your hair You cannot bleach it It must grow out Never apply chemical treatments such as perms relaxers dyes over henna Results can be scary I ve heard Once you decide you want to keep doing henna for a year or more you can buy 1 kg bag of body art quality mehandi henna The Indian grocer has it here in Vancouver 8 Put the whole bag in an extra large mixing bowl Pour in a pot of extra strong black coffee bit by bit Blend with hand mixer Keep adding coffee until it becomes like a yogurt not like thick Greek like the other style Not payable but almost You may need more coffee so brew up some more and why not have a cup At this point I add about 1 4 to 1 3 cup of Amla oil that I also buy in that grocery store It smells great and is a nice conditioner Spoon into 4 6 containers and freeze Of course don t freeze until you ve used the first batch on your head fresh The next time you henna take a container from the freezer and partially thaw it out in the microwave 5 minutes is probably enough just thaw enough to have a reasonable amount in the corners around the edges Use what you need and refreeze the rest One kg lasts a year or more for me When applying the first time you need complete coverage Use hair colour method of using a professional brush and 1 4 to 1 2 inch sections Make sure to use a lot of product Henna needs to really be thick especially around the edges of your face Those darn sideburn hairs are often missed It took several times to realize I really needed to slather it on for it to cover properly When needing your regrowth done just do the roots Overlapping is never an issue You don t need to pull the henna through You may want to do all over henna once every 3 6 months Don t be afraid of staining clothes carpets tiles or counters It all washes out Henna only bonds with Keratin in your skin nails and hair So don t forget to wear gloves Wrap head with long pieces of plastic cling wrap until it is sealed in there really well I go way over the edges over my ears and almost my eyes Do not let any hair be exposed as henna needs to be wet to work Leave in for 3 hours and get in the shower with gloves on and rinse rinse rinse until the water is clear then shampoo Then condition Clean your ears really well because it often has crept it s way into the crannies Hopefully you have a shower head with a hose so you can wash the shower enclosure easily Wrap a towel on your pillow until you ve had a couple of more chances to shampoo or condition your hair Don t wear white TShirts with wet hair for a week or two What rubs or drips off won t stain permanently so don t worry It s just a bit of a nuisance If you want to cover grey and you like bright copper hair henna is miracle I worked for an international hair colour brand and taught hair stylists how to use that colour I used the best products I know hair colour and NOTHING BEATS HENNA Grey coverage 100 AMAZING NO FADING Unless you spend a crazy amount of time in the sun you will not notice any colour difference After 3 weeks of every day in the sun for hours in Spain it faded a bit but still looked glorious CHEAP a year of colouring my own hair would have cost me about 350 and that s at wholesale price of professional colour Henna is 8 Plus coffee Natural non toxic non polluting Hope this helps someone I have my methods that make it super easy Once you decide you want to keep doing henna for a year or more you can buy 1 kg bag of body art quality mehandi henna The Indian

0,0,0,0,None,So braces I ll recommend substances in a second but they are made from a cold bending metal so if you eat something cold like ice cream they should give you a brief moment of bliss They go back to their original shape if exposed to heat So things I will recommend Cloves works very well to numb certain points of the mouth Just chew on it and keep the saliva in your mouth for as long as possible Oral gel benzocaine pretty efficient as a local anesthesia Acetaminophen and ibruprofen can be used in tandem and is MORE effective at treating tooth pain than most opiates Alcohol works good as both a numbing agent and a distraction Weed pretty decent pain relief with added distraction but if you focus on pain will literally feel 10x worse than sober If you re experiencing migraines from tooth pain I recommend caffeine from 50 150 mg don t exceed or it will make it worse I did not say it wasnt addictive literally all opiates are addictive I said it wasn t heroin which is much stronger and far more dangerous than opium Opiates can cause that too if you re worried go to a hospital means you definitely overdid it You just took too a high a dose for a beginner you ll be ok but if you feel that if you need help don t hesitate to go to the hospital Opiates will slow down your heart and breathing rate very normal just make sure you stay awake and are sitting up and it ll pass Opiates also release histamine the stuff responsible for allergies so that s why you re itchy So first of all using drugs to cope with any sort of mental health disorders can lead to psychological addiction or further potentiate the underlying issues I recommend some therapy doesn t work for everyone I know and I really recommend getting into exercise and health That being said in the short term they can help and coupled with actively trying to improve your mental health can decrease anxiety and depression to a manageable degree 1 GABA substances These are things like alcohol benzodiazepines valium xanax etc phenibut gabapentin or pregabalin These should NEVER be used for managing general anxiety of day to day or chronic anxiety and should really only be used for panic or anxiety attacks Using for coping with day to day anxiety no matter how bad WILL lead to psychological addiction and if chained together for multiple days will lead to physical addiction with horrendous withdrawal symptoms that can lead to death in severe cases 2 THC and CBD aka weed sort of For general anxiety CBD is the one for you lasts about 5 hrs and while not an incredible decrease in anxiety should bring it down to manageable levels THC the main psychoactive compound can also have anxiety reducing effects but is also noticeably psychoactive and can also lead to anxiety Make sure you know what you re smoking and lean towards heavier CBD than THC Hard drug 3 Psychedelics This includes things like psilocybin mushrooms and LSD and basically for SOME people can be like a 6 12 hr therapy session with permanent decreases in anxiety and depression That being said they can also exacerbate residual issues or trigger other anxiety disorders If you have no experience with psychoactive substances do not start with psychedelics Also they are not physically or psychologically addictive but can wreck havoc on your mental state if unprepared 4 Other hallucinogenic substances Things like MDMA or ketamine have been shown in medical studies to have extremely beneficial therapeutic effects like decreased depressive symptoms or the ability to cope with PTSD That being said MDMA can be a very dangerous substance and ample care and research should be taken when taking this substance 5 Other shit Kratom is an opiate that is currently rising in popularity and notoriety It seems to be pretty expensive per dosage but is legal but because it is an opiate should be taken with care and not repeatedly over multiple days Kratom is less addictive psychologically than other opiates like heroin but withdrawing physically can have very similar effects As for danger chronic use has pointed towards some kidney or liver damage but theres not a whole lot of research to that degree I AM NOT A DOCTOR ALL SUBSTANCES LISTED SHOULD BE RESEARCHED BY YOU But jumping straight to drugs has never worked for anyone and should be treated with extreme care as to not become addicted or psychologically dependent on a substance Get into exercise meditation therapy and a schedule before ever going to substances Clarification when I say general anxiety I mean the constant level of anxiety you suffer from from a day to day basis not random spikes triggered at random or by something If you want the softest least likely to lead to psychological or physical addiction with little to no physical damage after extensive use I recommend CBD or low dose THC edibles ,opiates^opium^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Well I have a rather unusual opioid story I have been prescribed narcotics for the entirety of my adult life Initially they were for chronic orthopedic pain That issue was resolved surgically after 15 years I thought I was done with pain and pain pills Not long after I started to get used to a life without pain I severely burned I still had a significant tolerance In the burn unit I told them I was opioid tolerant and the medication wasn t working very well They increased my dose and dosing frequency until it achieved satisfactory pain relief I didn t even get a chance to fully heal from the fire when I got diagnosed with brain cancer The location of my tumor causes Central Pain Syndrome which for me manifests as constant pain throughout my lower body They thought I would only live a short while but I m still here and unfortunately I still hurt Again typical starting doses didn t cut it I told my doctors They increased the dose Most of the time I can actually forget that I even have cancer all of my symptoms are adequately treated I have 9 year old twin sons who are much kinder and more understanding than I was at that age 2 years ago I had surgery to remove part of a brain tumor Not long after I got home one of my boys said to me Dad want to know what my favorite thing in the world is When we re going for a walk cooking supper folding clothes and we just talk to each other I replied Your favorite thing in the world is talking to your dad My heart melted He is a very kind boy Earlier this winter he came home from school and he said Can we get a new pair of mittens next time we go to town My friend doesn t have any Last summer the other boy shocked me Out of the blue he said Dad want to know my favorite thing about people is Every person has their own story where they came from where they re going and their own hopes and dreams They have a level of kindness and empathy I wouldn t expect from most adults let alone children I have nearly died 5 times now 1 I was camping with some friends back in high school I decided to sneak up on them by crawling under a truck I was under the front driver s tire when the truck started backing up on me Thankfully she immediately hit the brakes shifted into Drive instead of running me over the rest of the way I had a tire mark on my back for months after but I m still alive This one felt different than the others The other 3 times I was slowly dying this one would have been very abrupt but it didn t happen so I never had the light at the end of the tunnel or anything like that One second I was being run over then I wasn t 2 My wife ended a relationship to be with me This guy wasn t too happy about this She and I got married 2 years later Shortly after our wedding we saw her ex at a bar He asks me to come outside ALONE to apologize for 2 years of harassing us and threatening me I should have known better Next thing I know I get hit on the back of my head and someone is holding me down choking me My vision was fading to black light at the end of the tunnel and all that For a moment I conceded that I was simply going to die As the last bit of light fades out I somehow managed to find the strength to get them off of me My wife had heard the fight and she came out to help someone else grabbed her to keep her from helping me Once I got up I was able to help her We ran to our car and sped away Later we found out that her ex had paid 2 people to kill me And to make it even worse the price to end my life is only 50 worth of meth This one scared the shit out of me but in the moment I was fading into the black I felt a calm peace then found strength that I didn t know I was capable of and that strength is what allowed me to survive 3 I had burned my foot and leg in a brush fire and needed skin graft surgery The day after my surgery I had a fever obviously from an infection My nurse kept coming in and checking my temperature and it kept going up They changed my bandages and put on more antibiotic cream Temp went up higher They changed bandages again and tried a different antibiotic cream Temp went higher They changed bandages again and gave me oral antibiotics Temp went higher They changed it all again and gave me IV antibiotics Again my temp went up Once more they changed everything and increased the IV I heard someone say He s at 41 6 107F for those who prefer Fahrenheit as I started to fade out I was convinced that this was going to be the end of me I closed my eyes to picture my wife and kids and to pray for them to carry on without me I open my eyes and my room filled with glowing light A nurse came in whispered You re going to be alright in my ear and left I felt an all encompassing comfort and knew I was OK My real nurse came in to take my temp and it was back to normal A few I put nurse in quotes because the woman I described to my previous nurse does not exist The actual moment close to death was the same as before Just a calm peace Like I knew it wasn t my time but when that time did come it would be OK 4 A year and a week after the fire I had my 4th surgery on the burn The next day I had a terrible headache and I was unable to keep any food or liquid down Each day the headache gets worse It eventually gets to be unbearable The ONE time I look up my symptoms on WebMD it tells me I have Brain Cancer I shrug it off thinking there s no way I told my wife This headache hurts more than being on fire did She convinces me to go to the doctor I thought it was just leftover effects from anesthesia and I planned to just power through I go to the doctor and he thinks the same thing gives me IV fluids and a steroid shot and sends me on my way The next day I go back When I told him that the headache was waking me up in the night he ordered a CT scan A headache should NEVER wake you up CT shows a mass in my brain He makes an appointment at a larger hospital for the next day and I have surgery to remove part of the tumor the following day Something bad happened during the surgery so I woke up in the ICU instead of the room I started in I don t remember what it was that happened but they were unable to give me any pain medication after surgery because it could have masked the brain damage they were afraid might have happened I was at the lowest point of my life I had never felt pain anywhere close to this it was so painful that I actually believed I was dying Just like in the burn unit a year prior I closed my eyes and imagined my wife and kids and I prayed that they would be OK without me I open my eyes and my room is glowing bright again The same nurse from the burn unit came into my room and told me I was going to be alright As she left I felt that same comfort throughout my entire being and I knew I was going to be OK Again just that same calm peace 5 This spring I was in Northern Minnesota I go up there with my wife s uncles for our annual guys fishing trip I am a photographer so I spend part of the trip by myself in a canoe looking for spots to take pictures I do the same thing every year but this year I put on a lifejacket before heading out After a while I decide to head in for lunch The wind made it very difficult to get to where I wanted to go Long story short I end up tipping the canoe For a short while I was able to hold my upper body out of the water but the wind picked up again and I lost hold of the canoe I don t know the exact water temperature but there was still ice on the lake 6 days earlier so it was in the upper 30s to lower 40sF The shore seemed impossibly far away and my strength was fading fast For a moment I considered unbuckling my life jacket to let myself sink to the bottom I figured quickly drowning would be better than slowly freezing to death I close my eyes and in my mind I saw a recent picture I had taken of my wife and kids I decided I wasn t going to freeze or drown I was going to get out About 50 yards from shore I stopped shivering and felt nice and warm For a moment I thought I was just in shallow water and it actually was warm then I remembered that this was the end stages of hypothermia I give my last strength to get to shore I get to shore in neck deep water I grabbed hold of some reeds to try and pull myself out I pulled on them 3 times I was too weak to get out This time I was convinced I was going to die right then and there Everything was fading to black again I saw the light at the end of the tunnel but this time unlike the others the tunnel closed A moment later the blackness turned to white and I was sitting on shore I will never be convinced that this wasn t divine After a while I think to take off my clothes to get that cold water off of my skin It took every ounce of my strength to get undressed I realized that I was barely breathing tried to check my pulse but it was too weak to count It was sunny and 82F but I was laying there dying I finally think that I should be yelling for help Everyone else was in the cabin having lunch Everyone except for my wife s cousin he was fishing off of the dock He went inside and said I THINK I hear someone yelling for help Somehow he heard me from over half a mile away Nobody questioned him they all got on the boat to look around Hearing the sound of that motor filled me with joy unlike anything I d ever felt I was lying in the reeds and with my clothes off I blended right in I tried to sit up to make sure they saw me but I couldn t move hypothermia was closing it s icy grip They found me when they saw the canoe floating nearby Again I tried to get up but I couldn t They had to pick me up and put me in the boat We got back to the cabin and they carried me off the boat I had them put me in a chair in the sunshine they found my warmest clothes and put them on me I had one of the guys make me a pot of tea nothing on this earth will ever taste as good as that first sip of warm tea That cold water was by far the most terrifying experience of my life None of the others come anywhere close in comparison But that moment when I was right up to the line of dying I was filled with that same peace and comfort as before TL DR I have come close to death 5 times in my life 3 of them were within the last 3 years For 4 of them the near death part was very similar I was slowly progressing toward death my vision was fading to black I saw the light at the end of the tunnel The moment I start coming back to my senses I was filled comfort and peace far beyond anything else Each time I somehow knew that it wasn t my time but when my time comes it will be OK The other event was different While the other 4 were like a dimmer switch with me fading into the dark this was just on off I didn t experience anything unusual this time Edit formatting Hydroxyzine does

Fishing Trip Friday morning I head out on the canoe Not long after I freak gust of wind tips me into the cold black water I end up swimming half a mile in a 40 f lake it still had ice cover 6 days prior I finally get to shore and somehow manage to get out of the water The sun was shining and it was 82 f but I was lying there dying Hypothermia had gotten too far for my body to reheat Luckily I was rescued before succumbing to the cold The guys got me back to the cabin and put warm clothes on me I asked one of them to put some water on so I could have a cup of tea That first sip of Hojichi

0,0,0,0,None,This Exactly what I was going to say Look for people getting their sheets signed Don t ask people that shared in the meeting look for people that seem to be high Hell I swear I can hear it in people s voices when they use dope opiates Anybody else experience this phenomenon Hear a difference in people s voice on opiates GP can write methadone only for pain management not for OUD opiate use disorder So in theory a doc could write you methadone as long as he says it s for pain management Really hard to find a doc to do this unless you are a legit pain management patient I have known exactly one person that left the clinic because his doc at the VA was going to write his methadone for him Also typically doses for pain management are lower than what is used for OUD I understand the anxiety that comes with opiate withdrawal I really do That being said This advice should be taken with a grain of salt because it may not be conducive to recovery I would just make sure the rehab prescribed medication In general benzos are given for benzo dependence and alcohol dependency I was never physically dependent on either of those but whenever I went to rehab I made sure I had both in my system and self reported abuse and dependency of benzos and alcohol so I would get better meds Did it work Yes for me I got Valium and phenobarbital my personal favorite It also led to increased restrictions at first at one rehab I couldnt go off site the first week I didn t mind though Hope the advice helps I recommend miralax It s not a stimulant laxatives so you don t become dependent on it It works by drawing more water into the dry compacted little goat turds that come with opiate use Drink lots of water too It can take 24 hrs plus to work but it doesn t cause cramping I take prescription linzess everyday and still have to supplement with 3 doses of miralax to get good movement I also have IBS so my stomach is always doing stupid stuff and hurting like a motherfucker Good luck shitting ,opiates^opiate
0,0,0,0,None,I believe that terms like good and bad start to lose their meaning when you are acting under some kind of compulsion You did a good thing today unprompted You are a good person today Yesterday you were driven to steal in desperation Yesterday you were neither good nor bad you just did what you did Obviously it is not black and white but I don t feel you are 100 morally responsible under these circumstances Is it wrong for a starving person to steal food That is not to say in any way that you should not own every one of your past actions merely that you should be realistic about the degree of choice that you genuinely exercised I respectfully disagree with the other two responses to this comment A buprenorphine taper is standard practice in lots of places Everyone is making it sound like some sort of life sentence A close friend of mine just came off a taper of a few weeks following an opiate binge which wasn t nearly as serious as yours Honestly have faith in your doctor Actually I always wanted to be a bin man They showed us a video at school about how important the work is My parents didn t think much of the idea I should have followed my dreams I probably would have been happier I ve had a quick glance at your post history and I see that you are not opioid naive I also see that you have access to benzos Smoking is the best way to do 3 It gives a rush which snorting doesn t and you can smoke until you get where you want to be whereas with snorting it s more of a guessing game It s easy to snort more and more looking for a certain high and end up puking your guts out You might burn a bit of dope learning to smoke but it s less than what you d waste snorting it It really matters to me that you are safe I m not encouraging you to do h but if you are going to then you should know where the risks lie so that you can avoid them Test for fent It s uncommon in UK 3 but it s not unheard of and testing is not a hard thing to do so don t take any shortcuts Secondly DO NOT MIX I see you ve got bars and Valium there perhaps you like a drink too don t we all Plenty of people on this sub mix it all up but don t follow their example If you smoke clean 3 on its own then your risks of OD are really very small Add anything else in and all bets are off There s just no point in multiplying your risk by x10 000 Also benzos booze etc affect your judgement and you need your wits about you when messing with this stuff Finally be extra extra careful if using on your own All these stories yo I did this and that and had to be narcanned well they re only here to tell that story because someone was on hand to call for an ambulance Sorry for the lecture but you owe it to yourself to be safe I have super vivid dreams when sober following a binge Like just now I woke up from a dream in which I thought I watched an arty film about a girl with psychosis It was incredibly long and detailed and I can still remember lots of it If the film existed I would recommend it to everyone Yesterday was second day sober after a two day binge but I am still not back to normal ,black^opiate^dreams^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Also it looks like part of your original question hasn t been addressed Everyone is so different it s really hard to say where that tipping point of physical addiction is and once you really cross it it s just so hard to go back I was about 14 or 15 when I started so physically I was obviously still growing developing which I m sure affected the amount of time I was able to use without withdrawals but I seem to remember it being several months before I was ever really truly dopesick Dunno if that helps or not Edit I also just noticed you said you ve been messing with opis for about 10 years and have managed to avoid wd s Now that is impressive I really wouldn t push it any further if I were you well clearly I would seeing my history Would be a damn shame to head down that road after so many years of successfully living every opiate addict s dream I was much younger and more naive up until that point had convinced myself that it wasn t that big of a deal LOL Guarantee those dudes I was involved with are still in prison I ve managed to be an opiate user junkie for 25 or so years and have not been to prison Jail sure a hundred times That was the wake up that I wouldn t always be lucky unless I found legit income ,opiate
1,1,1,1,None,I read the post and comments and now I m confused because when I take opiates I get a buzzed feeling a heat flash and pass out for about 2 hours lmao Man lmao and I m afraid I can t get anymore after this unless it s an actual emergency because my doctors are aware of my opiate addiction according to them which sucks ass but hey thank you for the CWE help What have been your experiences with the hydros Any close calls with certain doses or anything ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Wow A year Now that s impressive I m a woman but thanks yeah it hasn t been easy Months away OMG I can t feel like this for months You are right Just recently I have been able to be a bit more comfortable but RLS kicked in again last night Do you think it s just the opiates or the combo This is true I am in absolute hell But I m not going back now I m too far The last 15 days have been utter and complete agony In the beginning only WD I could feel was opiates Hell Hell on Earth I don t even understand how people can post in the first week My first post was after 2 weeks clean because I physically could not move I think what I m feeling now is alcohol WD and nicotine I can t tell All I know is fuck that shit and the fuckers who make it Good for you The cigs are tough to quit Really tough I really don t recommend quitting everything It seemed like the right thing for me because my habits were hand in hand Pop a pill drink smoke If I m not drinking I don t smoke If I m not taking opiates I don t drink Very strange how our brain forms habits Weed caffeine a bit of kratom I m keeping those 3 for now Have a wonderful day I ll check in with you later So I ve been using kratom only if I need it I took 8 mil yesterday to get me through the day Most I ve ever taken What s your experience with it I really want to rid of all substances except weed occasionally but after 8 yrs of daily opiates abuse plus alcohol abuse plus smoking I feel that kratom is ok for now Or am I just getting myself into trouble ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,I mean everyone s chemical reception to opiates is different But I will let you know that damn near every single opiate addict started out with I ll just take them once every few months on occasion to I ll just take them when I have easy access to them to I ll only take them on the weekends to I ll only take them at nighttime to I ll only dose twice a day and then so on So if I were you I d turn back now and never look back especially considering you ve had addiction issues in the past with other substances I mean I truly think it s different for everyone s body I ve been on Oxycodone for 20 years and yes they work just as well for me as they always have I ve never had to take more than 40mg a day unless for surgery or something of that nature I get excellent pain relief from my medication and it s worked better than even other opiates for me Even stronger ones didn t work as well Dilaudid Morphine So I disagree I think it absolutely is debatable Everyone s body composition is different I m not saying I m the majority but I know others with endometriosis who have been on an opiate for 30 years I also know someone who has been taking the same Oxycodone dosage for 26 years she s never abused her medication or had to raise her dose for adequate pain management Idk man I hear what you re saying and I agree but the absolution and assertion you speak with as if it s impossible I disagree with I guess that s very possible However I ve been on them 20 years now and have yet to have to move into insane dosages to still get pain relief My comment about heroin or crack was that many think opiate use will always progress into harder worse drugs It can absolutely be normal to get a little rebound anxiety from opiates It could also be a sign you took a little too much but not too much enough to cause overdose symptoms Absolutely Just take it slow You can always take more you can t take less after you ve taken it Just remember that My advice would be to not get into opiates at all but Judging by your post history it seems you re developing a problem with your prescription I can see why you d be lashing out at others who benefit from opioid therapy long term because it seems you aren t in that class There s nothing wrong with telling your doctor you d like to try other alternatives Good luck If you really expected opiates for the FLU you re a moron Jfc of course the flu sucks it sucks for everyone Wtf would you need opiates for the flu for Well when it comes to opiates many doctors err on the side of caution especially considering opiates are meant for short term use And I have multiple chronic diseases and am on opiates myself so I understand your frustration Err ing on the side of caution may constitute seeing you more often to monitor your pain and opiate necessities I ve met PM doctors who do much shadier things than simply wanting to see you every three weeks to maintain your pain medication prescription ,opiate^opiates^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,Judging by your grammar and spelling you re either very young or very lacking in life experience It s clear you have never been on MAT because you would know it doesn t change your state of mind Yes it alters your brain chemistry As I stated I know it is a partial agonist It has a huge binding affinity for your opiate receptors That s how it works After abusing full agonists for a decade a partial agonist is not changing my state of mind I can say that with 100 percent honesty I m also likely to a far larger extent than you aware of the definition of high I asked you to expound on your opinion To which you responded by attacking my knowledge That s not what I want Don t just say lol no ur high I really want to understand why you think the way you do I and anyone else on bupe will tell you We aren t getting high We aren t nodding So why in your mind does this not count as clean time Edit Just wanted to add Why do I take it if it doesn t get me high That s two fold First and foremost it removed the cravings for heroin Second it staves off withdrawals Both acute and post acute If you have ever gotten clean without MAT you know the hell of PAWS I can t do that on my own yet Hence the Suboxone Thank you for an actual well thought out and valid counterargument Yes I ve kicked bupe one time It was similar to a mild heroin detox only it lasted for over 3 weeks Difficult absolutely Not unbearably so though I m not looking forward to it but I know I can do it It s the PAWS that scares me As far as methadone and the Rx heroin they do in Europe well that s a good question I ve never done methadone but I ve heard it gets you high If that s the case then no I don t think I would consider that as clean If you keep the dose low enough to where you don t get euphoria then I suppose I would count it as being clean The prescription heroin depends on the dosage We addicts have all been to the point where you are just using to get well If the dosage is low enough that the patient is not getting any euphoria from it then yeah I personally would consider it clean I ve taken subs in jail with no tolerance and gotten blasted I ve taken subs during addiction too early and gotten PWDs Ive been taking subs now as maintenance and have not gotten high That s why I personally see it as being clean I guess the way to look at it is as a stepping stone Using bupe to fix the issues in my life while taking therapy to learn more about why I used in the first place Attending outpatient to learn how to live sober All while maintaining on Suboxone to stave off the apathy inducing post acute withdrawal Once I feel like my life is at a stable enough place which should be soon I m going to start tapering off Slowly To allow my brain chemistry to begin adjusting to normal life without the bupe saturating my opiate receptors I know I ll still experience PAWS but I ll be far more prepared for it than if I had just been banging dope a couple days ago Honestly if you are this scared why are you even using opiates Brain damage is caused by a total lack of oxygen to the brain for a period of time If you were sedated enough to achieve this you wouldn t have even been aware of falling asleep You wouldn t have even fallen asleep Your ass would ve fallen out People legit OD every day and don t experience brain damage You were asleep on oxys dude Relax ,opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,That s just not true Go to pain management if you legitimately need them That s the most likely place to get an actual opioid prescription I ve never had a problem with my pain doctor prescribing them Stop calling them Perc 30s Those don t exist And what are your doctors doing for your pain UC and Chrons aren t really the problems that opioids are designed to help The constipation would undoubtedly make them worse It also sounds like you were not at all using Gabapentin correctly You don t increase dosages like that It takes weeks for Gabapentin to really begin working as it is supposed to But yes Gabapentin withdrawal was immensely worse than any opioid withdrawals I ve been through Opioids when used as designed and directed DO work for most people If someone misuses their drugs that is on the individual Like I said Oxycodone has been absolutely amazing for me I can see how people can become addicted and for transparency after all my time in Pain Management I am addicted My body is physically addicted to my medications That s not an unexpected consequence of using them They do work They do improve my life dramatically and they do for millions of people around the world The epidemic is NOT from Prescription Pills People are dying for pressed pills and laced heroin Whether their addiction started from a prescribed pill who knows I can absolutely agree that they used to dispense pills way to easily a decade or so ago But they are not prescribing like that anymore People are not dying from prescribed medications They are dying for their addiction and fake pills There are ways that addicts can overcome the addiction but many don t want to That s not a doctors fault ,opioid
1,1,1,1,None,I m not familiar w kratom but I ve heard it becomes hard to get off just like any opiates if taken too long The subs are just to get thru the worst of the withdrawls I got two white ones so it s alittle easier than say a black or brown kat ,opiates^black
1,1,1,1,None,English is not my first language so its often hard for me to get my point across What I meant to say I ve read a paper that concluded that some peoples bodys cant handle opiates as good as others They may experience more or more intense side effects and are more prone to complications I ve been having this ever since I started doing opiates In the beginning it was just waaaay more stamina in bed but as time progressed it was more and more challenging to finish at all When I am not that horny but do it for my wife sometimes I just cant finish I could do her as long as my muscles and cirulatory system allow but no way to cum Some people dont metabolize opiates that good Be glad this stupid stuff wont get you hooked So just better let it be I was speaking of doing both at the same time but keep in mind Every drug is gonna damage your health some more amphetamin some less opiates Combining drugs is even more detrimental Seizures can even lead to death i call that permanent health damage so it would be very stupid to use a drug combination that heavily increases the chance of seizures when you already know that you are prone to seizures without said combination At least dont be alone DONT DRIVE dont operate heavy machinery Maybe i was just lucky with the quality but without opioid tolerance 10 15g mixed with grapefruit juice gave me a real buzz Only thing that stopped me from taking it was that I found it almost impossible to swallow that disguisting sandy stuff ,opiates^opioid
1,1,1,1,None,For someone with no dependency who has never had one on opiates there will not be any withdrawals For someone who USED to be dependent there could be mild withdrawal symptoms even after two years of clean time Once that pathway is created the brain is able to find it again pretty much right away No Taking your normal dose won t really help So the best course of action is to avoid getting pwd in the first place Always take SMALL doses of buprenorphine 1 to 2 mg increments every two hours That way if you do start to feel worse it won t be nearly as severe and it will go away relatively quickly In order to reverse PWD you would have to take a monsterous amount of what ever your DOC is and that may not even work plus its very dangerous to do so Buperenorphine has a higher binding affinity than almost everything except fentanyl and hydromorphone Buprenorphine also has a much lower intrinsic activity Its this change in activity that causes PWD so when the bupe rips the full agonist off the receptor and replaces it there is a very rapid down regulation of opioid activity That is felt as severe withdrawal Maybe mild But it might not be Since you have a previous dependance on opiates that pathway gets reactivated fairly quickly It will probably not be anywhere near as bad as it was the first time you detoxed but expect a few days of feeling like shite Its the other way around Opiates after sub receptors are blocked and nothing happens Sub after opiates within the last 24 hours PWD ,opiates^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Not the OPcommenter but was in the same position Needing to quit and trying for like 2 years of my 5 year active and finally only getting it to stick when I wanted it I didnt know the difference between want and need at the time though What changed for me wasn t anything actionable or even motivational though everything around me was shit I was sick and couldn t even get well because all the dope available was garbage My money was gone I was sick as hell on the verge of losing my entire life and decided enough was enough Every person has their own reasons it s different for every recovered addict out there A lot of people will say they have to reach their bottom first But that looks different for everyone The only constant seems to be that cliche of you only change when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change Whatever that means for a person I survived a trauma myself and used opiates to cope after benzos alcohol anonymous sex and an awful bout of anorexia stopped helping I understand what he s facing and what relief heroin can give he ll never feel that again and accepting that fact is the hardest bit of all But It s not healing whatever happened it s hurting deepening the wound and not even letting him scar I m sure he knows this but can t honestly feel this truth Because it sure feels like it s helping but that pain and that fear is biding its time right underneath growing with every act of avoidance he engages in It seems impossible to face and battle so he uses which makes it stronger and him weaker There will be no healing and no moving on until he can stop using and confront the pain I wish I had advice to give you to help him But the only advice I have is to help you and that s to draw a bottom line and leave if he can t comply And that could be for now or until he s proven his desire to be and stay clean if you really need that Addiction will destroy everything you love in him as well as your good intentions Whatever you do to try and help him will be twisted into the ugliest bullshit that only furthers his addiction and deepens both of your pain It s gut wrenching to realize but there s nothing you can do if he s justifying and bargaining because he s only proving to you that he doesn t want to change Subs get you high at first It s like a normal opiate high but eventually they build up in your system and only make you well normal Doctors prescribe methadone to addicts and methadone definitely gets you high when taking enough ,opiates^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Yeah my trajectory is definitely upwards over the past couple years so that s good I guess I think the valium booze hangover probably added to the negativity but in the past few months I ve just had too many incidents of getting too drunk with no benzos involved and embarrassing myself And I know it s because I miss opiates and I m just trying to compensate with something else Haven t felt that low in a while I gotta figure something out that shit can t keep happening Yeah I totally know what you mean I m proud of myself when I don t do something foolish now Its so easy for some people but for me I have to put in a serious concerted effort because my default is to just keep going until I m fucking gone It sucks because I m doing so much better than I used to but I still suck Like no heroin anymore Almost never use benzos Just a few oxys at the end of each month So now I m just drinking like an asshole I know I m overdoing it bc I just miss opiates so I m numbing myself with whatever I can ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Would kratom help only with stuff like psychological cravings or would it help with the physical withdrawals part too I ve heard people say that it s an opiate and others say it s coffee I ve tried a few times I m just looking for an opiate to ease the comedown from the stims I use on the weekend H seems like the most cost effective States domestic Vendor has solid reviews Personally sampled good shit from him although it wasn t an opiate Also has oxy presses but honestly states they re made with fent He says no fent on the china white though I feel you bro Been down this road with benzos Started with etiz and clonazepam ended up with clonazolam Still trying to taper from abuse of that shit with diclaz I ve tried H before A point I d do tiny bumps being opiate naive It lasted me a couple months One night I dicided to just go for a bigger bump like 3 times my usual baby bumps just to finish it shit fucked me up Ears clogging up nausea fighting to stay awake Didn t really touch opiates apart from kratom Recently found odsmt and been doing it daily for 2 weeks and also moved to boofing it 20 mgs of norcos hitting already Disappointing for 8 a pop gotta say or maybe my tolerance is fucked from the other opis I ve been taking however this sort of warm feeling is making me crave a bit of that feeling I d get from those times I d tried H Odsmt and kratom are more of a stimulating high Appreciate you sharing your experience broski ,opiate
1,1,1,1,None,My parents picked me up from drivers ed I had just popped my first adderal 30 mg Third time I had ever been high in my life As my dad drives me home I try to convince him that adderal will be the only thing that will make me as successful as he would ever want me too I go home and do all the homework for that day and the days prior I fell asleep and woke up to my mom getting me up for school Still feeling the effects of the adderal I run downstairs at record time and take a shower and get ready for school in a matter of ten to fifteen minutes My mom calls me and stares my eyes down to see if they were dilated At that point they weren t My dad sits me down and tells me he know I m on adderal because he used to take black beauties in the day He tells me I m going down the wrong path as I deny everything Ended up getting searched at school that day because I wouldn t stop talking about adderal Lol Kratom Honestly a drug that has changed my life It got me off of Xanax and adderal while also habitually taking opiates when I could find them I take kratom now for pain motivation focusing tasks Work anxiety and being a better father This is not the substance for everyone But it could be your best friend if used with the right education I get this same effect from kratom which is very similar to the complex varieties of opiates Doesn t matter what kind of strain of kratom I can always find a booth of endurance with lower doses That added stamina and confidence makes you able to do things you never though These means working your muscles so hard that the never thought was possible Your body is overworked by that extra oomf the day before I do too buddy everyday Adderal as well That s all my dreams consist of Isn t that just torture ,black^opiates^dreams

1,0,1,1,None,I think when I removed the need to use caffeine to survive work I e quit my job and just relaxed and leisurely studied and practiced skills and made business ideas I can joyfully drink a couple strong coffees a day Also I m much healthier now I eat a ton of food and really nutrient dense too I m a little chubbier but happier When I was working in high stress environment and chugging black coffee for energy I crashed I was also lean and barely ate enough and slightly hypothyroid I appreciate and respect your experience because it s true I m not saying you didn t experience what you did What I m saying is I ve been there When I first started coffee it was like that euphoric and great and then eventually run down and beat to crap Quitting starting quitting starting Now I drink coffee because it is really a joy and i don t feel any of the negatives unless I purposefully overdose as a health experiment Coffee really helps metabolism and liver in my experience The reason I am making a case for it is I know if someone has a problem and wants to quit they might be coming from where I was at where coffee felt so good it became a drug of abuse Anyways If you do relapse take my advice Eat some liver or oysters any super nutrient dense food but those are tops and after that drink a strong coffee with a ton of milk and sugar and some salt and gelatin or collagen powder Just try it once if you re gonna drink it anyways Maybe take some aspirin with it And eat enough food You might be amazed at how it can make you feel with so little downside and being so sustainable I really empathize with what you are saying because I ve been there It fucked my mental state up too But now it s a boon If you felt the way I felt off some of the ideas presented by ray peat you would be as enthusiastic in sure I respect everyone s experience but if you try what I m saying and your nutrition is in line to support the increase in metabolism you ll quickly understand my POV But also in the same way I reached this point due to some determination based on the way others described it I had to experiment a bit and get diet in order before the positives greatly outweighed negatives As far as neurotransmitters go I have been a recovering opiate addict I was really worried about anything that d mess my chemistry up I don t want to feel bad I always thought my chemistry was more sensitive and prone to anxiety and depression So if I say coffees not an issue anymore in this way I hope it makes an impression I m glad u read that link ray peat has some really interesting and for me helpful ideas His info changed the way I view diet and health I basically abolished my orthorexia via his writings and related info If you stay true to staying off caffeine then my hats off to you sincerely I respect anyone s decision to make a sacrifice to better their health and life Will do I often ask Jesus to help me when I fall prey to sexual thoughts and it works The most unsettling thing is my wet dreams are often focussed on just body parts Last time it was just a woman s torso from behind and below the waist These aren t humans but objects I feel like it s an expression of a disjointed fixation on sexual body parts I want to view women as whole beings and not just sums of their T and A and other sexual parts I will pray for help against these spiritual assaults It s a little ironic because nazi was a term created to disparage national socialists That lady is probably not a national socialist The national socialists had no real qualm with the black man to my knowledge and actually treated visiting black American athletes like minor celebrities afaik It s hard to tell what is true and not because the history is put through the wash to serve curent ruling interests I can be almost certain 6 million Jews did not perish in gas chambers or masturbation death machines though ,opiate^dreams^black
1,1,1,1,None,No that s not how it works at all That s a massive myth Benzos and uppers are perfectly fine to mix and so are opiates to an extent It s because people who shoot heroin and coke together a speedball would drop dead often cause the coke would wear off and they OD on heroin because anti histamines are addictive on their own and are heavenly when combined with opiates Probably an hour or 2 ish Its not nearly as major as lsd tolerance tho You can also take a tablespoon of tumeric with a teaspoon of black pepper as it provides mild maoi effects and that can push you to where you want to be ,opiates^black
1,1,1,1,None,I m so proud of you I began on my road to opiate addiction about a year ago I now am 32 days sober for the first time since my addiction started and attend NA meetings 3x a week without fail I ve met so many supportive and amazing people who ve helped me in my journey to recovery Don t give up you re doing amazing I promise you it ll all be worth it Addiction is something we have to learn to cope and live with the rest of our lives but we can always make the best of it and take things one day at a time 3 Hey hun I ve actually switched onto methadone and since I ve been on a 67mg dose I ve been having significant side effects that include insomnia fatigue exhaustion anxiety restlessness constipation occasional numbness and tingling to lower extremeties the doctor ordered some bloodwork to check my iron and thyroid levels and CBC and is switching me to metadol D which is a diff formulation of methadose that I ve been on There s also been research studies that show 30 of people on opioid maintenance therapy can develop sleep apnea So I wouldn t be surprised But over 6 years sober and still have side effects It may be something your body has developed overtime itself Yes you re right PAWS does only last up to 2 3 months ,opiate^opioid

1,1,1,1,None,I am a recovering opiate addict and I m even on the same kind of medication Shannon s on But what she s not understanding is that just because she s not been using doesn t mean she s healthy her impulsive actions and overly emotional outbursts tell me that she s not putting the work into her recovery She s still acting like an addict just doing it sober I think AA Alcoholics Anonymous calls it a dry drunk I lost my father to suicide five years ago this month I m not gonna lie to you I totally went off the deep end turning my previously bad addiction to opiates to one that almost took my life The day my father died was the same day I started shooting up if I hadn t gotten locked up a year and half later I would surely be dead by now I have two and a half years clean and one of the main things that keeps me that way is knowing that I have probably made my father proud I m sure that your father would want the same kind of life for you and I promise you that your grief will only be that much worse if you use You think it will deaden it but when it does hit you it s gonna be tenfold Feel it now go ahead and process it We are supposed to feel things good and bad Distract yourself do yoga do whatever you need to do to keep from picking up We are here for you And if you need to talk please don t hesitate to message me Praying for you both and much love Ok I was just curious I know that Shannon takes the same meds I do and they re for opioid dependence The opioid epidemic is a problem pretty much everywhere but up that way its really bad from my understanding I ve just always kind of assumed or figured that his death was possibly drug related All the more reason she needs to tread carefully with all this medical mj and other drugs I m curious if she s even been honest with her doctors about her family history of substance abuse If anyone has MaKayla s live recorded please post it she has deleted it from IG and I totally missed it She has got to stop using her kids as pawns to upset Calaen If she doesn t want to be with him then fine But don t punish the kids And the fact that she accused Calean of gaslighting is SERIOUSLY the pot calling the kettle black It is true that naloxone does block opiate receptors but it s only activated in the buprenorphine naloxone combo if you try to inject it ,opiate^opiates^opioid^black

1,1,1,1,None,Nah I know what explains the mess and the fingerprints give it away This person is a junkie When you re using cookers or even smoking Heroin you leave black soot marks all over Light switches door knobs towels To me this explains the state of the car and the black fingerprints Likely someone was living in the car for a period of time as well or just used it as their place to get high in private Either way it would make sense to me only would know if I saw the person Sorry but you re actually functionally retarded if you were taking narcotic drugs and not expecting to become addicted form a habit Not saying you are but everyone who argues they didn t know the pills were addictive or weren t told Anything produced from the Opium poppy is gonna be wildly addictive Everyone knew as soon as they made them Oxy would be dangerous Did they care No But people should do their own research as to what they re putting into their body Not just blindly shovel Percocet and lortabs down their throat and oh shit I got addicted how could the doctors not tell me this would happen Heroin was the non addictive response to morphine Morphine the miracle cure for laudanum addiction And laudanum hailed as an elixir of the future One that could cure those addicted to opium smoking Funny how things come full circle once we start to look into these substances ourselves I tried looking around but can t find the article because of the huge amounts of content written daily about him and this was like way when he first launched his campaign I read it They also were talking about how his sexuality would be a barrier towards black voters Different things like that If someone has a link that d be dank or if anyone knows people from south bend holla Nah homie I backpack and camp a bunch I m very active and run bike and swim I live in a pretty temperate area so there s no real time I can t go do outdoor activities I honestly honestly think it slows the aging process down You gotta realize opiates in their pure form are not harmful to your body They re one of the few exceptions of drugs It s the cuts and the adverse side effects infections respiratory depression other accidents that cause heroin related deaths They re not neurotoxic like most stimulants They do not cause organ toxicity and the withdrawal cannot kill you Dehydration depression suicide are more likely to kill you during them technically if you had an unlimited supply of pure opiates if you were extremely careful you could probably use opiates indefinitely for you re whole life and experience few health problems from the drug use Yeah but that s not a toxicity thing it s a physical reaction Respiratory depression is why people die when they OD Narcan only wakes you up enough to breath and then get you to a hospital so you don t die on the street If you don t get to the doctor immediately you will end up falling out again I mean directly toxic like alcohol will be directly toxic And over time will destroy your organs If you abuse opiates for 30 years and never have an OD ie you don t do enough to cause your breathing to stop it s not gonna cause your heart to give out one day But it s the cuts in the drugs infections and like you said overdoses that are causing deaths While pure cocaine WILL kill you Pure alcohol will kill you And besides tolerance is funny what would cause respiratory depression death in someone who is opiate naive would probably barely get me high And vice versa what it takes to get me high would kill like one or two people if they d never done heroin They always say before you start to IV that opiates keep you young If you re able to keep your hygiene up it slows everything down I dunno about a cellular level but definitely slows down all your normal bodily processes I ve known lots of addicts myself included Lots of my friends especially girls who are in their 30s look like they re in their 20s still Dunno why ,black^opium^opiates^opiate

have the energy and strength to beat up and prison rape Goliath and there s literally nothing in the world you can t do That s the whole point to me but maybe I m just turbo weird I feel you my man just got out in the beginning of the month Opiates Cocaine and Meth In a partial right now Longest clean time I ve had in over a decade I m in group in a halfway house where I m not even supposed to have my cellphone so I can t go fiddle fucking around on YouTube but it s YouTube man just search for how to smoke black tar or some shit like that Medicare Part D data is public not the names of the patients but the names of the meds prescribed by the doctors and is available in malleable form When I last got a script I pulled all of the previous year s data for my city put together a data array of all doctors and the scripts they wrote Did a stacked sort of first by doctor and then by medication removing all unnecessary medications I then found the doctors with the specialty I needed pain management who had written the most overall Opiate scripts particularly of the Oxy assortment and hit them up Worked like a top for me and all it took was some publicly accessible data and some middle school level data parsing skills I just actually found the data I believe have to hide my phone where I m at so I m rushing so check this out for reference and to get started https data cms gov part d prescriber I don t know how to say this but I m kind of a big deal You re in every big rap and pop song but you spend your time fiddle fucking around on the Reddit Opiates sub Get the fuck out of here This isn t really a speedball it s doing a fairly low amount of week Opiates in relative proximity to a low amount of Cocaine You ll be fine True speedballing is taking Cocaine Heroin and water mixing it up in a spoon drawing that bitch up in a needle and banging it in your body preferably your neck if you want to be a pro And to answer your question it s not safe at all far from it the best things in life rarely are Glad you stayed with us Reddit pro tip my man when you re tagging a user like you tagged Chase in your post you use the u tag not the r tag The r tag is for subreddits e g if you were linking to this sub you d r tag Opiates and the u tag is for users Don t listen to this dude he has no idea what the fuck he s talking about as he has proven multiple times in the past few days on this sub If you are completely Opiate naive i e you haven t used Opiates prior and have no tolerance 2 3 may honestly get you buzzed or even get you smacked 5 in such a case may push you to the point of nausea and puking nausea is extremely common with Opiates especially with those who are Opiate naive I d say start with 2 3 3 probably wouldn t hurt you then wait about 15 30 minutes If you are Opiate naive as it seems you are you should feel a warming buzz and euphoria See where you re at after 15 30 minutes and if it hasn t produced the desired effect or not enough of it layer on another 1 2 Then repeat this cycle until you re at where you want to be Good luck Just to clear this up from my other comment since it seems like a lot of folks don t know this Afghan Heroin doesn t really appear in the US anymore mostly just the EU UK and Asia It is almost always brown and almost always 3 Heroin base Tar is pretty exclusive to the US as it s almost exclusively made in Mexico as its garbage It s the result of poor and incomplete processing refinement The brown 4 in the US is primarily from Colombia with a small portion produced in Mexico White Heroin in the US is almost always Fentanyl or a Fentanyl analogue This is because the only area that produces truly pure white really off white Heroin that is actual Heroin is SEA mostly Thailand and the Shan state Most of that Heroin stays in Asia with some of it making it to the rest of the world oddly enough the primary destination being Canada and there you have it That is how the origins of today s Heroin breakdown If you re asking what people like better between the American options you re really asking about Mexican BTH brown or black tar Colombian 4 brown or synthetic Canadian or Mexican 4 white and grey I ve heard 24 25 but everyone is different I m mega against Vivitrol to be honest I have a turbo bad reaction to Naltrexone ultra depression maximum malaise and general not giving a fuck edness From those I ve heard who ve used it successfully though somewhere between day 20 and day 25 they describe the exact same feeling they can literally feel it wearing off and they often tell me that they get the worst cravings they ve ever had seemingly worse than before they got the shot oddly enough I ve had a few friends actually die because they were on Naltrexone they hit day 20 25 they got turbo cravings and then rather than getting a new shot they went the fuck it route banged a mud shot their tolerance had dropped to nothing and they ended up cold slabbed and toe tagged I honestly believe that if you re going to use MAT or recommend MAT for that matter it should be a MAT solution that actually addresses the craving directly and on a regular preferably daily basis Since diacetylmorphine isn t available for MAT anymore in most of the world that leaves Methadone and Suboxone I honestly believe Methadone is a trap and most Methadone users would be better off with Heroin but Suboxone actually seems like a very strong and reasonable approach I m on it now and doing well and while I haven t been on it long I was on it before successfully for over a year I not only lived a productive and socially acceptable life I didn t use illicitly and I was able to taper off without withdrawals literally the only Opiate I ve ever been able to taper They weren t invented in Canada you dolt they were dyed in Canada so people could tell the difference between the different Fentanyl analogues Fentanyl is produced in Canada because it is easy to get the precursors there from China It is not always cut with Caffeine either China White isn t a term exclusive to Canada though It existed long before Canada had Fent long before Fent was on the scene It was originally used to describe pure Heroin which is white such Heroin only really comes from SEA thus the China bit Anyone on here will tell you I know a fuckton more about Fent Fent analogues and Heroin in general than you can ever hope to so stop giving out bad information and go back to sipping your lean Yes almost definitely from Mexico Almost all tar comes from Mexico Tar is a crappier product than 3 or 4 as tar is the result of an incomplete refinement process As a result black tar typically maxes out at 30 Heroin which is why I was saying it is inherently not fire Afghan dope while Afghanistan produces somewhere between 60 70 of the world s Opium is very VERY rarely seen outside of Asia and Europe It is just about the only thing you ll find in the UK and EU but finding it in the US is rarer than finding a sober hobo Additionally Afghani Opium is refined into Heroin in a handful of places primarily Pakistan Almost all of the Afghani Opium that is refined into Heroin is turned into Heroin base 3 I don t like speaking in absolutes as one never knows but I can fairly confidently say that NONE of Afghani Opium is turned into BTH All that comes together into forming my point that just by reading the post and seeing the picture rather safely inferring that OP is in the US and acquired BTH of some variety it is almost certainly neither bang dope nor Afghani which is to say the original commenter has no fucking clue what he s talking about Unfortunately that seems to be an epidemic on this sub these days though ,opiates^black^opiate^china^opium

1,1,1,1,None,Not really why people take acid tbh I guess it s different for everyone but Iv never dropped acid to feel good In fact it s always pretty uncomfortable even if it s worth it overall If you wanted to feel good you would take opiates and mdma Still dont you think it s unrealistic to make the legal age 25 It would just lead to the black market for weed continuing which defeats the whole point of legalisation The biggest market is for people aged 20 25 Also brain development is different for different people Some people dont finish brain development until 30 Should we make the age 30 to protect those people I feel like once you are an adult you should be responsible for your own dumb decisions and no government should get to say what someone may or may not consume Outbreak was in China Anyone who pretends to know how many people are infected are silly If you think for a second China wouldnt try to hide how severe the situation is you are naive When a chemical Explosion kills thousands they pretend 40 people died Yeah just like with other opiates pissing becomes harder on kratom Not a big deal though and still easier than pissing on morphine ,opiates^black^china
1,1,1,1,None,Wont get worse you ll just prolong how long you have to WD in general tho Every second you re not on an opiate your tolerance will go down From everyday use of heroin I slowly spaced it out to every other day then eventually week then two weeks a year eventually passed where I didn t WD since my last use and felt fine for a month Then hell broke loose again Lol Dude my last time using was a score I made in my home city known very well as the murder capitol Got off a plane there to see family and scored at 3 am with a friend and then a living nightmare happened I threw up over 40 times in just 12 hours the puking having started only ten minutes after I SNORTED A HALF OF A LINE I started choking on my vomit lying between a wall and a toilet was completely unable to breathe I was certain I was gonna die After my vision started to fade my throat loosened up and I rolled over and vomited an enormous pile of blood I got in my car and blew my dad s phone up telling him I needed to get to inpatient immediately and so I drove ten and a half hours back to my dad s in the state of eternal sunshine After nodding out at the wheel and almost crashing at least a dozen times I miraculously made it home and got into treatment I took a drug screen and blood test absolutely nothing showed up not even opiates They later came and told me I had used pure fentanyl and that the amount was enough to kill a decent sized animal Currently over 4 mo s clean but I ve been working on changing that I just want some normal black and I ll be happy but I m too big of a wuss to cold cop so we ll see ,opiate^opiates

0,0,0,0,None,She does want to quit the pressure i think is twisted in her head like the price she gets I think she feels compensates for the stress and she can safely make enough to survive stay high and not have to do anything and shes never tried to be sober before so that scares her but yes I genuinely think she really WANTS to I mean I say that with no sarcasm at all I think any of us who ve actually quit for any point of time nose what it s like I made it just under a year before I fell back and I have no idea what is going to be like for her because with mine wanted help that I was incarcerated so I was forced to detox and withdraw I have no other option or temptation to tempt me also withdrawal from my DOC doesn t come with a physical withdrawal as well at least not in the same sense as opiates and I guess for clarification today s going to be the first day to actually set a taper dose originally we were just trying to go by feel can I see how far she can go in between peach butt the research wasn t very helpful because stress and everything else were other variables that were uncontrollable so decided to say fuck it and try a different approach no it s not being taken from her but she did ask that it be put somewhere she can t get to and have someone other than her control when and how much that s why I was asking for any advice because I have no idea I don t want to make her absolutely fucking miserable because she doesn t get enough but that made me think of something I have a question on a different approach narcan isn t that instant detox I mean if I remember correctly the way she phrased it Narcan would be like a week s worth of withdrawal in 1 minute yes it s extremely painful and miserable but how long does it last and is it a quicker solution will it have any lasting effects and the idea never and to my mind until she said it as a joke so I m curious now ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,Yea alot of people dont realize what these drugs do I m sticking to what i know works im sick of guinea pigging drugs that arent narcotics atleast narcotics have a good rapport with effect I use opiates and narcotics responsibly im gonna try and get ketamine if i can from them for pain well see im curious i have bad cervical stenosis could i talk to a pain management doctor and get the right opiates i need through the telephone My thoughts exactly Its crazy how people dont think about this or atleast aware of it ive seen the true opiate crisis go down docs overprescribe for no medical reasons quit then people turn to the street No doubt it was planned did anyone know the old guy from The price is right highly profited from the prison system from toiletries etc The Prison system keeps so many people wealthy I would highly recommend it It s better to be safe then sorry Like I said my blood pressure cuff saved my life a couple times and that was without the use of opiates It s good for anyone to keep track of their blood pressure It should be promoted more for health but I dont know anyone with one tbh Glad I have one though We need an ashton manual equivalence for opiate use Very nice post Positive thinking and positive post I like it whats dangerous is your BP droppiing to low keep a blood pressure cuff handy It s literally saved my life and allowed me to go to the hospital because of other health issues high BP so this was without opiates I was recently prescribed dilaudid and have zanaflex but my BP drops to low for me to feel comfortable taking it Oxygen deprivation is felt I have to knock my self out of it It creates more nods and its very easy to die this way I m also tapering benzos I m at a low dose but it also contributes to BP dropping so im very careful cause i don t want to die but all of it contributes to BP dropping when mixing So be very careful Get a blood pressure monitor and be safe I feel ya man i was prescribed a lot of xanax in the past and its tough I never thought i d get clean from them I m still tapering benzos benzo withdrawal is so much worse then opiate Best of luck friend atleast your trying I wanna cry whenever i take it so its just not for me I have zanaflex too ill probably just take that it drops your BP so bad though My minds tired so its just going crazy with recollections I hate seeing people you used to know in your dreams its so creepy but there hellish dreams I wouldnt even try explaining them from the 1st night I like gaba better but it quits working for me eventually and the withdrawal is horrible The nightmares are literally from hell Creepiest shit and i can remember the dreams vividly ,opiates^opiate^dreams
1,1,1,1,None,Wow There is so much diversity in everyone s knowledge about pain and opiates to treat pain My pain eats my opiate euphoria ie If I m in an immense amount of pain I get zero euphoria from said dose my euphoria is wholly in relief from the original pain I do recognize the problems with opiates prescribed inappropriately which is how people obtain the high they get from opiates I ve broken both legs twice each with many other major injuries and on my 30th surgery with only palliative care as any expectation for the future It is people like myself that are being thrown out with the bathwater in this epidemic 8 feel for anyone suffering wds today though Noone deserves that well except these 2 folks I know but that s another post for another day Y all be well I ve been involved in 2 near fatal mva s and broke both legs both times I am mostly metal from the hips down and woefully under treated for an opiate naive individual Had a procedure today they give most people versed for I needed propofol for twilight sedation Yes recreational users are setting themselves up for a very ugly reality if the worst does happen ,opiate

1,1,1,1,None,It s just an interesting chemical really It s approximately 500x stronger than morphine but the side effects that often occur with an overdose or someone who needs a high dose for pain relief are lessor than with classic opiates If this was researched more way back when it was synthesized it could have possibly reduced OD deaths I was thinking of maybe taking 1mg IV when if I try it for the first time definitely not opiate naive but better safe than sorry since it d be my first time using that method I ve only sniffed H and it nearly fucked up my nose Haha most I ve felt is minor sedation and very minor euphoria after taking 5g over the course of a night with alcohol I guess to be fair to her I tried to abuse it but it s not a drug with a high abuse profile It can potentiate opiates tho I agree tramadol sucks ass It s just all I can get for opiates until my chronic pain appointment on the 4th Goes with the Xanax sort of well and Xanax increases the seizure barrier I usually black out at 8mg ir but I think the xr gives you smaller doses over an extended period of time I am a victim to scenario A however scenario B is why I m very careful about taking opiates I find the withdrawals from them way worse even though they can t kill you I feel like it d make me throw up just from the rush of water It makes me nauseas just thinking about it You do you though I d probably sniff before I tried injecting Then I d skip rectal and just go right to IV but if snuffing gets me higher than orally I will probably be fine sticking with it I don t tend to get too into opiates Although might get another script soon because of how bad my back pain is Just 2mg of the hydromorphone orally was so ineffective Even for pain and I want to stretch out what ever I get as long as I can which means making lower doses more effective Probably just an excuse to go down a slippery slope but fuck it ,opiates^opiate^black

1,1,1,1,None,My husband sleeps naked or in underwear One day at 4 am a drunk guy hit out car in our driveway next to our bedroom window and tried to leave his car was too messed up though I always sleep with clothes because I have 2 kids and I need to be ready for whatever So I hop out of bed and see what s going on and my husband comes out with his phone in is undies He wasn t vulnerable or hesitant at all just recording and yelling at dude I m now convinced it s fine be naked and run around in an emergency I will deal with midnight puking and bad dreams and he can deal with drunk guys at 4 am The bubble of numb yes but also it works like an anti depressant in a way your body won t produce dopamine naturally anymore and the opiate replaces it It gets regular eventually and some people need medication but our bodies are very accepting to opiates as humans The more I think about it the further back it goes I ve always chased a rush I climbed trees as tall as my house at age 4 5 because I was so good at it I got a little rush from the risk and confidence combo In 6th grade a lot of kids were smoking weed and cigarettes so I tried some from my moms ashtray and got a big headrush I started choking myself to pass out because it was such a rush My uncle started paying me in beer and cigarettes to babysit his kids when I was 14 By 15 I was full on smoking cigarettes and weed every day Then I got a fake ID at age 15 and was buying beer and cigarettes for everyone Then I got my wisdom teeth pulled and loved the pills Then I would go to festivals and get acid mushrooms or X and thought I gained more insight of my mind than was possible sober Then I dated a guy older than me so he was going out to bars all the time and I would tag along with my fake ID Then we became codependent Then I had a pretty heavy pill habit that eventually lead to heroin Then I quit opiates because I realized how dumb it was but I started doing coke instead I would do any drug at that point I then started struggling with major neck pain and was prescribed a lot of pills I started using heroin again when I would run out early Then I got into treatment and did suboxone maintenance then relapsed a month after my successful taper Then I got on methadone and stayed on it for 7 years I was ok with doing it for the rest of my life but I recently got off of that because of all the work I was able to do while stable on a program I m feeling a lot better about having control and I don t want to use I think I m prone to addiction because of mental illness and family history Knowing what I know now at 35 I will definitely take my kids straight to rehab if they start going down that path I did I wish I went to rehab earlier in life ,dreams^opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None, tramadol is a real opioid I m well aware about it s properties And anything other than that is unfortunately extremely expensive here 1 pill 5mg oxy for 40 when I can get 100x100mg tramsdol for 110 I m also well aware about the W D but they re not as severe as all the others ,opioid
1,1,1,1,None,Most pharmacies actually ALL pharmacies in Canada have signs on the door that say we do not stock opiates we pickup upon request only But if your saying that you got thousands at a time then either 1 the USA needs to adopt that program or 2 The signs are a lie to deter theft and they actually DO stock opiates Just a question if you don t mind did you demand all the opiates or just the oxy s I mean since your there anyway might as well get all the opiates I probably would have asked for all the testosterone Benzo s ADHD meds cialis viagara anti estrogens thyroid pills basically everything with street value lol However I understand if you only robbed them or their oxy s I can attest to being so deep in addiction you don t see the big picture however at my most desperate of times I adopted a mindset of anything will do rather than tunnel vision on my drug of choice so I probably would have cleaned the place out of everything they had with value I actually got really fortunate and got my hands on some gabapentin pregabalin so those are going to help take 90 of the withdrawals away once I eventually jump off for once I was able to put all the connections I made during my addiction to good use lmao I have been using the gabapentin on days I lower my dose for example Monday 20mg AM 20mg Lunch 20mg PM Tuesday 15mg 300 gpent AM 15mg 300 gpent Lunch 15mg 300 gpent PM Wednesday 15mg 200 gpent AM 15mg 200 gpent Lunch 15mg 200 gpent PM Thursday 15mg 100 gpent AM 15mg 100 gpent Lunch 15mg 100 gpent PM Frisay 15mg AM 15mg Lunch 15mg PM So this has helped more than I could ever explain But I ve had to be real careful not to get hooked on gabaoentin They are prescribed in detox centres and rehab houses across North America I have searched Reddit and there s countless members of the opiate recovery community here that credit gabapentin and Pregabalin for helping them get through withdrawals but there s also an ex tire community of people trying to get off gabapentin and Pregabalin too so I ve been careful not to take it more than a few days in a row and then I take at least 7 days before taking the gabaoentin again Honestly I feel like they help so much that I could jump off and only feel 10 the withdrawals but I have a 2 week holidays scheduled from work in 2 months so I m going to continue my tape and come off then If you can find either of these drugs I can t urge you enough to try them but use them wisely i took too much the first day I had them cuz duh I m an addict what else would I do lol and I felt drunk basically so I ll never take 600mg again lol But if use correctly they are apparently the best drug out there for curing withdrawals once we eventually jump off Sorry to hear that you went backwards in your taper keep chipping away brother Cheers Hey I have come clean once before I used clonodine but found that I couldn t stay away after taking it so i only used it at night and I don t like e idea of my blood pressure dropping right before I go to bed since that is what s making me tired from the clonodine is the blood pressure drop I have a BP machine at home as my gf is a nurse and my BP got dangerously low after taking it she was waking me up during my last detox and taking my BP after taking clonodine and it was like 75 40 so dangerously low So I m going to pass on that for now I am actually wanting to take a more aggressive approach to my taper that s why I asked about using gabapentin because I thought maybe I could make larger jumps than just a 2mg decrease Dropping from 150mg per to day 60 only took 2 weeks but that s cuz I had such a huge dose so it s getting harder now For sleep I m not sure what I m going to do the gabaoentin will take away the restless legs I used it last time but only had 10 pills and spread them out and damn they helped I picked up 20 x 75mg Pregabalin today so I m going to use that the first 5 days and then use gabapentin for the next 10 and then come off Hopefully I won t get too addicted I also have tons of vitamin C kratom and 200 loperamide on hand but I wanna stay away from the latter 2 as their just opiates and combining them with gaba or Pregabalin will probably get me high lol I ve actually started working out 6 days a eeek and eating real healthy during the taper because I thjnk a healthier body will an easier detox it only makes sense that the better shape ur body is in the better it will perform under the stress of detox I competed in bodybuilding shows and actually made it out of the regional level and onto the state level before my addiction so it was easy for me to pick it back up and hit the weights and the 6 7 daily small high protein meals again Since I have the knowledge and muscle memory already established I m hoping that will help me sleep a good workout lots of vitamins fish oils coq10 pro biotics none of them directly aid sleep but I m praying that a healthier body will fall asleep eaiser it s a stretch but from what I ve read the restless legs and anxiety jitters at night are caused by nutrition deficiencies mainly magnesium but some others My doc gave my mirapex for restless legs so that pregab gaba should take care of the RLS But I would love a medication for sleep weed makes me sketchy and anxious and I freak out I used to use motion sickness tabs but those cause RLS to get worse during withdrawal so I don t know what to use melatonin is useless and I can t get any benzos only thing that works is clonodine for me and I can get that but like I said it knocks me out in a dangerous way Sorry for rambling any suggestions for OTC sleep meds Or even prescription ones I could always ask around the ONE good thing about being an addict is that when u wanna quit you know where to find all the comfort meds ahaha I was not meaning I d completely replace an opiate dose with gabaoentin I was referring to mixing them throughout the day here s an example I m just trying to think of a way to implement the Gaba It seems silly to have access to this amazing drug yet still suffer withdrawals when I lower my dose during my taper Day 1 Hydro 6mg x 5 Day 2 Hydro 6mg x 5 Day 3 Hydro 4mg x 5 but take 300mg with each dose Day 4 Repeat Day 5 Repeat Day 6 Hydro 4mg x 5 without gabapentin so basically when I want to Lower my dose I will add gabapentin for the first 2 3 days cu gaba potentials the opiates a WD s I may feel and then after a few days I will cut the gaba and just do my new dose of hydros And a few weeks later I ll repeat lower my hydro dose and add 300mg gaba with each dose when I m lowering it until I m comfortable then take away the gaba this way I can lower my opiate dose with WD s along the way Would this work or no Gaba potentials opiates that s why I am thinking of adding them to my dose whenever I lower my dose so I can potentials the new lower dose for the first few e days and stop the gaba once my body is used to the new dose It Makes sense in theory lol I ve had 4 friends taper suboxone and when they all jumped off every last one of them told me this naked opiate detox look like a vacation it lasted 30 40 days for them and they all relapsed after a month I d rather take the opiate detox of 3 4 days lol Everythint i read on forums says the same that suboxone is 100x worse when u come off But I appreciate the suggestion Thank you ,opiates^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,I m very experienced with opiates Although I ve not dabbled in them in years because honestly it gets bad fast So I def know the difference in Oxy etc and Kratom But while Kratom is a weak high it still effects some of the same receptors neurologically And while it is an opioid agonist rather than an opiATE I still think there is going to be a level of cross tolerance I suspect it will be minimal Yeah you d prob say I have a low tolerance And I can see how it must work really well as a treatment to help someone step off opiates I m not a heavy user I was 6 months ago And off and on here and there it got off the wagon for a couple of days Then I get back on it My tolerance is enough that I snorted 12mg this morning and am feeling pretty nice I mean it s not like oxy it s a peculiar drug And I m not necessarily trying to get an oxy type buzz from because I know that s not how it works Sounds like what I hear you saying is beyond that initial 12 mg to do anymore would be a waste Right 8 don t have a ton of them so I m not gonna be using it daily for a long time Just experimenting I ve got a pretty high opiate tolerance at this point in my life But I just haven t used suboxone ever until recently Certainly Yesterday morning I started really small like 2 mg I know lots of ppl suggested 1 mg or less But I don t think they understand that Kratom regardless of your opinion of it was going to have some degree of cross tolerance 9 AM 2mg felt nothing Noon did 4 mg more At this point I could tell something was in my system but it was of now recreational value Around 4 PM did 4mg more Again could sense an opiate but ever so mildly This morning I started w 12 mg all at once up ye ole sniffer There was definitely a degree of recreational value in this dose But it wasn t anything to write home about Around 3 sniffed another 8mg and that was the end of my supply If I had more then tomorrow morning I probably would have tried 16 or 20 mg at once Long story short even though Kratom is weak a high tolerance to it must give you a high tolerance to the other actual opiates In the end I actually enjoy a dose of 25mg Kratom over the 12mg of bupe Sorry there is more to that story I thought I was replying on a different sub I didn t start off trying 12 mg First day I tried 2 mg and didn t feel nothing at all Then tried 8 Felt a little bit Then today 12mg and it was ok I m basically out of it now I just happened across 4 pills and was really hoping to get some recreational value out of them And I didn t know if Kratom tolerance for absolute sure effects opiate tolerance Now I know It does If you use it during opiate withdrawals it DEFINITELY causes the already existing insomnia and RLS to be worse Thank you for this Yes I figured maaaayyyybe starting w 1mg I used to use opiates pretty heavily years ago But haven t done anything in years except a few codeine pills I didn t know though how much of at all my Kratom tolerance would impact the dosage I should start with Anyway I ve got 3 8mg tablets I don t have to be in any rush I can start small and still have plenty to experiment with ,opiate^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Ever hear of snus It comes in little pouches that u tuck on the side of ur gums like dip but it doesn t require spitting and comes in sealed packets It s definitely doable in a concealed manner They should sell it at most stores that sell cigs The best kinds are from Sweden where it originated General is a really good one but they make American brands like Camel now though not as good The other good thing is it s not nearly as bad for u as regular dip Anyway that would satisfy nic cravings as would something like nicorette gum Yes but ur generally not gonna see those people on a forum like this which is mostly enthusiasts who ve crossed that recreational line a long time ago lol I think I read before that out of every single person who takes opiates in a given year the vast majority aren t addicted Kinda tough to really verify though It s certainly more profitable than real dope And if ur getting pure fent wholesale I m not sure what could have a higher profit potential Just for an example let s say we re talking about a finger 10g of solid 50 purity heroin for 750 To make an equipotent finger of fentadope instead you d only need 200mg of fent so 0 2g of it So let s say u ordered a full gram of pure fent from China and got a good deal at 50 I don t know the actual prices but that sounds feasible You d be able to make 5 fingers or 50g of fentadope which would easily be worth 50 g itself So just with that scenario right there pure fent can have a 50x profit potential No way ur getting anywhere near a 50x markup with real dope or any other drug I can think of What can beat that This is why dealers can sell it so much cheaper than real dope and make LOADS more profit doing it The usual way is to just score slit the pods at the opportune time and collect the opium latex after it oozes out It contains morphine codeine thebaine and lots other opiates alkaloids They usually do this a few times to collect max opium Another way is to process the entire plant stems and all called poppy straw but that s more of an industrial large scale method Are u sure u have the right kind of poppy with morphine I ve never tried opium like that but I d love to grow it myself I live in a recently legalized state and was able to grow my own cannabis for the first time this past summer along with tomatoes and that was awesome I d love to have my own plantation with poppy and coca thrown into the mix too though I love gardening but I d love to process my own H C as well lol You ll get a little higher That s how I ve always used opiates redosing through the day instead of just doing 1 large dose all at once ,gum^opiates^china^opium

1,1,1,1,None,I use ceramic tweezers screwed onto metal I got them from China is all I know I m looking forward to Donut Operator putting out a video on this Seems pretty black and white but it s an out of context video There have been so many cases where until the body cam or details of the incident are made public people go nuts on Twitter Yassssssss My setup on a China tube mech with a Drop clone with a ceramic bucket smaller but way cheaper than the dropkick insert so far is still in the works Have you considered using SS That s what I ve been building my mechs with so far My ohms is wayyyyyyy lower if you actually mean 2 0ohms I assume you mean 0 2ohm which is where I have mine 0 5ish is probably better but I want it to hit hard ASAP Ayo from r ChronicPain I d say kratom but it s weak sauce compared to literally anything else What s weird is it straight up kills the euphoria that other opioids provide which a lot of people see as a bad thing but for chronic pain I see the ceiling effect and other weird quirks to the plant as ideal for long term use Or at least as ideal as you can get because nothing is okay for long term use tbh I threw up every prescription opioid I ve ever taken but I can count on two hands how many times I ve thrown up kratom I just can t keep that shit down but kratom is a godsend I would also just like to say my mom is a pillhead I got the fuck away from her because she was off the deep end I don t abuse the medications I am provided and consider myself a pain patient not a drug addict I draw these lines between addiction and dependence say that just because I don t ramp my doses or seek drugs which would actually get me high instead of what taking the same dose of kratom every 4 hours does to me that I am somehow avoiding being like her At the end of the day the difference is minimal You re or me in this case still choking down a ton of drugs every day It s a lot easier to say that you re different than everyone here that there are zero things in common between the homeless people shooting up on the street but that s bullshit I m not trying to like burst your bubble because I ve been right where you re at in the past unsure whether to post here or there unsure if I m really in any way related to people who abuse the same pills that I need to survive etc It s fucked I used to blame people in this sub for my meds getting cut off I know now it s so much more than that but it s hard to see what s going on behind the scenes if you don t know what to look for Andrew Kolodny and PROP are who to blame Purdue Pharmaceuticals starting this leg of the mess of an opioid epidemic we face in the late 90s early 2000s There s a lot of bad shit I have to say about the police in the US but I have yet to meet one who I believe would protect a child predator Yeah cops don t rat out dirty cops racist cops and overall shitheads who are powertripping with a badge and a gun Yeah there s enough of them doing bad shit that I don t fucking trust them not to shoot me or do something else fucked up But this isn t another unarmed black person they shot or drugs planted in another car Pedos are something murderers and rapists in prison for the rest of their lives will see as deplorable and will carry out vigilante justice on I believe the people who hold positions of power either turn a blind eye to or actively engage in pedo shit but your average day beat cop Nah He has a kid he has family and he s not living in a palace I believe he he hates this guy as much as we do His boss Now that I could see being a bit more likely I think your average day beat cop might kill an unarmed black person I don t think they ll protect some guy sniffing a 3 year old s panties at an open house I only let opioid naive penises fuck my girl bruh That dick doesn t last nearly as long once they ve built that tolerance and earned the title junkie And I mean he s gotta have enough dick for me and her so stamina is key ,china^black^opioid

0,0,0,0,None,This kinda hits close to home Just this past thanksgiving the night before I found my uncle dead from suicide in my parents basement in the most horrific way possible the details would only haunt you if I told you he was a recovering addict and after he had gotten sober his mental health literally just took a dive and within about 18 months of removing the drugs and alcohol he was just a shell of the person he once was What was spooky is that in the two weeks prior to the incident I would come home I had moved back to my parents to help them with my uncle for a little while and he would just be standing in a completely pitch black room staring into the abyss We live on top of a mountain on a lake and it is pitch black up here because there is zero light pollution about 3 4 days before the incident he kept asking me if I was scared that people cops fbi cia etc are listening to my phone calls and that I need to be very careful when I m using the phone and so on I would ask him what he meant did he hear something etc and then he would abruptly change the conversation but then return a few hours later with the same comments sadly I think he was hearing voices and that s ultimately what pushed him to do what he did We notified his dr numerous times before this happened and they literally did absolutely nothing He was telling the dr I m having bad thoughts etc and all they did was say do you think you need to go back to the hospital and of course you already know why his answer was And because it was a state program they just didn t give a shit at all we live in a fucked up world That fucked me up bad for a few weeks crazy ,black

1,1,1,1,None,I have never smoked it successfully but I ate a good chunk of it in India and woah what amazing opium dreams Both me and my friend had the same kind of dreams wide open wavy fields of green grass and wild flowers and blue skies It was weird because the dreams changed like every few seconds but was still the best thing ever Woke up the next day feeling more refreshed than ever before In my experience benzos take away the euphoria if taken while high on an opiate But if I already took some benzos and then the opiate I would get all euphoria plus the extra sedation from the benzo An update I got them today and they are in fact capsules with tiny balls pellets inside Very easy to empty crush and snort Like you said with Dilaudids like they were made for snorting And I have to say it was probably the best opiate high I ve experienced I m not a big fan of heroin I think it s really overrated My last favorite were Oxy and Morphine combo orally But Hydromorphone intranasal is better in my opinion Roughly the same duration as oral Oxy Which is quite short like 2 hours then a mild afterglow I started with maybe 1 5mg felt the come up then nothing more Took maybe 3mg more less than an hour later and got cozy Now several hours later I have a mild headache But it s not too bad These aren t Dilaudid so they won t be made up of the same setting So possibly they won t be snortable Like some manufacturers of Oxy make their pills non snortable with some of their binders and fillers I think I ll try a small bit of the pill crush it and snort Just to see if that works Otherwise my other only option is boofing Boofing Morphine in my past has been a waste so I have some training to do Wouldn t want to waste these Hydros for 35 bucks a piece They re really hard to come by where I live so they re kind of a luxury opiate ,opium^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,Jesus christ Im not trying to refine it into morphine I just asked how opium compares to hydro and oxy because I know what those feel like I meant like chandu The laurens grape seeds I got are black the queens were white tan Dark purple sounds amazing any pics Yeah that s one of the teks Ive read It seemed too easy like I was missing something Good to know its pretty doable But like I said Im looking to make something more traditional like Chandu or something I can put on a bowl Im not a regular opiate user so I dont have much of a tolerance Opiates aren t my thing but Id like to have some around for when the mood strikes me or if I accidentally hurt myself ,opium^black^opiate
1,1,1,1,None,What I meant was that in particular with opiates especially opioids painkillers like hydrocodone and oxycodone for me unlike other drugs and alcohol when I found a substance that did so many things such as increasing my energy confidence self esteem motivation libido and decreasing my pain anxiety and depression basically making me feel like SUPERMAN it was so hard to stop taking it I have found nothing else since that comes close to doing all those things this is what I meant ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,stims are my favorite honestly i ve fucked with opiates and they never got me feelin as good as stims something about the energy and clean feel good high from em that i love plus it s super fun to get shit done vs just falling asleep on downers smh ,opiates
1,1,1,1,None,It builds fast and drops fast too so like you can take 4mg 6mg whatever like everyday You ll black out sometimes or most times in my experience Then you go through some really bad withdrawals And 1mg can hit hard Maybe that s just my experience but also what my friends say as well Also it is extremely addictive and can lead to bad things I m personally trying very hard to get myself off them but it s so hard I tried it once I fell in love but had to pull away somethings are too good to be true and hearing from people in active addiction to recovery that s seems like the case I m an opiate pill addict it s expensive but manageable but the thought of heroin again is always there so i dont know your gonna get mixed reviews nobody will stop you and nobody should force you I have a high tolerance to benzodiazepines I use to mix them a lot and with opiates and alcohol Now I mainly use them for the minor withdrawal symptoms I get between doses of opiates and I try to only use them when my anxiety level is pretty much unbearable I always keep some Xanax and K pins if I smoke weed which is very occasional drink or go on opiate binges They make life much easier that s for sure My favorite thing to do is purposely not eat before taking any opiate making them hit harder and stronger Then keep a Xanax for when the come down starts from extended opiate use Tramadol is a weird drug but it did the trick with helping my pain and even gave me a nice high except it does give me extreme dry mouth and nausea I guess my biggest problem isn t a super high opiate tolerance it s that I m not effected by certain pain meds and very susceptible to benzodiazepines and SSRI s I m just hoping I can find a nice opiate that works for me consistently without having to turn to heroin I am willing to try diluadid again does anyone have suggestions on the most effective way to get the best high from them Also does anyone have suggestions on how to take OcyContin that have the XR wax on them I am always looking for the most effective way to dose on any opiates I can get So I appreciate all the tips and tricks everyone has to offer And I am happy to share my experience and knowledge Being able to tell my story and hear others is quite nice I have tried diluaded a few times but it has yet to work on me I honestly have no idea why I ve been around people that take 8mg and start nodding out and I don t even feel a buzz after taking 16mg Even morphine I have to take at least 60 mg to even feel something But I can take 20 40 mg hydrocodone or oxycodone and get a decent high I am a natural Redhead and have read about certain medication especially pain meds that I need much more of to feel the same to what everyone else feels I know I need extra anesthesia if I go under for surgery and double what normal people need at the dentist for Novocain I guess I just want to find something that works for me it can be really frustrating when you re with some friends that take opiates and you take twice as much and still don t feel anything I don t want to do heroin but it would be nice to have something that actually gets me high ,black^opiate^opiates
1,1,1,1,None,If you are mainly trying to feel the effects of codeine but you also wanna throw benzos into the mix then does moderately on codeine like you would and slowly mix in the benzos until u feel right with a high tolerance to benzos I would still go slow on it Codeine alone is good at moderat doses but for some people they also would add a mix of benzos I find that it diminishes the opiates ever so slightly every one s got a different reaction to these combos Enjoy yourself man stay safe What about combinging opiates with other opiates does it potentiate it Does it overlap one another and what was your favorite only opiates combo ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,I m doing tar rn for exactly the same reason Had been like a month since I had pills but I needed that opiate relief So yeah I was also worried about fent Sounds like smoking is your option I did try a dabs rig to smoke my tar inspired by OPs here on reddit but it was wildly unsuccessful never been skilled at dabs anyway I should figure it out tho After 3 days of smoking tar on foil my lungs are ready to jump out and leave my body Also smoke a pack of cigs a day Poor lil babies Well if you re getting pills you d need to crush the entire thing and mix it to test for fent So I dunno what s best way to use after if not snorting I m a snorter or smoker of pills but anytime I smoked pills it s keeping it whole and running it Yes on foil for me Prob not a good idea as aluminum does vaporize with heat I m not known for good health decisions lol Maybe just eat the powder Or I ve heard of people mixing with water and dripping that into their nostrils Like I believe a cold water extraction so the opiate dissolves and the fillers drop to the bottom And then get a syringe without needle and drip that into your nose holes Less trauma to the nose that way but given your nasal history I m not sure if even the liquid would be a good bad idea But likely better than powder So true about the 80s lol I can t believe I started using opiates with those in high school and didn t OD die Wassup with this numbering system It s just black tar Ended up getting a deal and got a gram for 60 ,opiate^opiates^black

1,1,1,1,None,Yep people are just haters Personally kratom has helped me a lot still gives me a pretty good buzz and for the most part keeps me off H I still have some binges here and there and even after the binges I feel the kratom So dont knock it cause it doesn t work for YOU Isnt worth the search maybe for you but its helped a LOT of people so saying it isn t worth it is just ignorant Tbh I d way rather be on kratom as my management drug over subs or methadone any day Oh well jokes on you I can get a kilo and last me a month or two Its brought up in this sub because for a lot of ppl it s a legit way to get off opiates or stay off them or just using it recreationally A very affordable way at that Dont take kratom expecting to feel the same exact effects as a real opiate like oxy you might feel somewhat similar effects but itll never be the exact same but it might he somewhat close So dont just go taking huge amounts to feel more of an effect you need to experiment to find your own personal dose Smh no not only for WD I take it every day and still get a decent high from it but it s a different kind of high Reminiscent of a low mid opiate dose mixed with some upper pep But still it s own thing Yes I did h for 3 years and getting off with kratom was a breeze and after a few days when my body got used to the kratom it would STILL get me pretty buzzed if it took enough and I was doing up to 35 per shot multiple times a day So yes even after years of abuse it still worked great for me and gave a decent high you have to experiment to find your own personal dose and give it a few days if you re coming off of real opiates Idk if this is true but I feel like the real opiates have to get kicked off the receptors first before you re able to feel much which might be why it takes a few days for effect Kratom for sure Ppl say hurr if you have a tolerance you wont feel much which is a load of shit it depends on the person ofc but for me I used h heavy for 3 years made the switch to kratom gave me a decent buzz then and still does now It won t feel exactly like a real opiate but it s fairly reminiscent You just have to experiment and find out what dose and strains work for you just buy from an online vendor not locally Might take a few days for you to feel much though especially coming off of a habit Yeah you re right everyone s different but I feel like if ppl actually gave it a chance they would like it Not just taking a dose or two and being like it does nothing more like a few days at least Especially if you re coming off opiates those receptors need a bit to clear up for the kratom to bind better I just personally feel it s much better to be on a semi opioid like kratom over a full one like other maintenance drugs plus the fact it gets me pretty high still but I m not knocking whatever works for people Eh not neccesarily It depends on the person etc but for me I think it helps with anxiety being happy work etc Like I ll still get decent euphoria from it just nowhere near a real opiate Probably won t feel nothing wrong I used for YEARS and it still gives me a pretty good buzz and is great for cravings etc Dont be expecting a crazy full opiate high cause that s not what you re gonna get People push it on addicts for a REASON It s not exactly suboxone or methadone but IMO far superior ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Strength or type of pill or tolerance has nothing to do with the question Only had a few puffs n thought this is stupid ill just eat it Does oxy get 100 destroyed by smoking a few small puffs or do u need to smoke it to a black mark on the foil for it to be gone I said probs bullshit because its some shit I heard of some fuckhead Telling me to get help why the fuck are you going around commenting on all my shit Im from sydney australia idk where your from but I doubt you know anything about drugs here Ive had bars that were just straight fentanyl You cant mistake that opiate feeling I doubt the ones im talking about had fent in em I took his word with a grain of salt but to say there is no fentanyl pressed bars is bullshit maybe where YOUR from but not where IM from It wouldnt black you out But even with a tolerence it makes your memory super fucking hazy ,black^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,Thanks so much for this I ll look into all those resources and I have used suboxone in the past but never as prescribed I do need to work on my underlying stuff and related issues its been hard and even harder without drugs even though I do still use It has been a strange experience I do feel I wasn t fully ready because I wasn t done with opiates or ready to give it up and still in massive denial after my overdose and death of someone close to me same week from the same drug despite being open to ibogaine and it helping me for a while and the progresses I did make in rehab I just never was really ready to really give up all drugs I do have hope though and I know I need to keep trying and at least do something even if for now I still struggle I just want to find things that make me happy again outside of opiates and drugs I used to love to learn and create and starting there again will benefit me a lot ive got a long way to go but I need to start now and be deligent Verrry distant future if I can budget to do ibogaine again given I dont die first but I m trying not to use opiates as heavily as I was overdose preibogaine time ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,Because you re new to the substance Its sudden raise of mental dependance once you start something new because of how much it helps It will slowely go away and even if you do get a real mental dependence after awhile it will go away and you will learn to go without it As long as you re perscribed you should be good because you alwase have it and DexAmp Vyvanse Adderall is the safest idk abt safest maybe most lenient scheduled drug you could withdrawal from in my opinion It seemed hard st first but after withdrawaling from oxycodone its a piece of cake now You are just tired and really hungry and sometimes have minor depressive symptoms but thats nothing compared to a opiate or benzo withdrawal Tolerance doesnt raise quick on amphetamines either ive been on the same dose for 1 5 years and pretty much get the same affects except a bit less motivation Tramadol is an opiate that can have stimulant like affects on norepinephrine and whatnot at high doses My friend had a seizure from taking a lot and went to the hospital He survived and was healthy and fine the same night Ive also heard about it being dangerous at high doses and that just confirmed it for me But idk people get seizures for so many different reasons The same night my friend had a seizure he took 10 000 mg of gabapentin which is an anti seizure med and is almost impossible to OD on which honestly probably reduced how severe the seizure was and goes to show how strong the tramadol is Placebo most likely I dont think its enough to affect you much at all and the peptides might not even agonize MU kappa or any opioid receptor Most likely your bodys way of saying you need gluten I would go to the doc With opiates even in a lower dose of oxy 5 10 mg you will get decently warm on the inside like cuddly and euphoric with a head buzz and relaxed yet motivated Im not gonna diagnose you or anything but i would get everything set with a doctor and try not to think about it much and just do what feels right Dextromethorphan DXM d 3 methoxy N methyl morphinan is the dextro isomer of levomethorphan a semisynthetic morphine derivative Deadiversion Related but doesnt act on the Mu opioid receptor Thank you I appreciate the civil conversation They re related I said its not an opiate but related to one Snorting muscle relaxers like Cyclobenzaprine isnt great obviously but zanaflex is great yes ik its not xanax lmao it acts sorta like a benzo in a way and gives you full body relaxation even while w d Im perscribed adderall for ADHD and take it everyday for awhile now I appreciate the concern Yes I know thats why I said do not take unless doctor says its ok i think I did atleast But I take Zoloft with adderall which has a higher reuptake inhibit affinity for serotonin than St Johns wort and im fine Doesnt mean everyone will be but the main concern is serotonin syndrome but its not a huge deal imo I would just go to the doc ask for a blood test tell them what happens after you eat gluten bread but dont mention the opioid stuff The blood test and other tests will most likely give the answer Placebo happens most of the time without realising By accident Im not sayimg this is forsure pleacebo but just you going out of your way to ask about it makes you think more about it and you are saying that you are more sleepy etc etc Nothing wrong with it hell I wish i could do that Carbs The type of carb and carbs in general may give certain affects like that especially since they are rapidly absorbed and used for energy I don t reccomend trying oxy or anything but if u do then you will see a huge difference obviously Ill do some research because this is very interesting and i appreciate you asking the question Im just having a hard time even if studies show its true believeing bread gluten has opiate peptides strong enough to feel One thing i think it could be if you have celiac disease allergy that interferes or may interfere with gluten is just the way its interacting with your gut The reaction mixed with the use of carbs may cause a raise in body temperature which opioids do the same Thats the warm cuddly feeling but its specifically internal temp and you get tired and fall asleep You might wake up in cold sweats due to your intestines and body having a hard time processing the gluten Taking atleast 2 days often or a week sometimes off will help with the magic It will blunt though no matter what And the reason you feel the magic is because thats the opiate magic Starting opiates for a good 4 months you ll have motivation and a sort of energy but still having depressed CNS etc Its because of dopamine release You still get dopamine release from adderall even if its lower than normal that mixed with the high dopamine release from oxy or opiates in general just bump the euphoria a notch higher For me though im not wasteing 15 mg oxy on adderall If i want full opiate affects ot full adderall effects i take them spread out seperate Stay safe brotha ,opiate^opiates^opioid
0,0,0,0,None,Sounds like you overdosed the percs by just a bit Normally when mixing cocaine and opiates the depressant effects of the opiates are counteracted by the stimulant effects of the cocaine However uppers tend to wear off quicker than downers and as it does your body gradually slows down to a stop as it was only kept alive by the coke Sounds like you have a definite problem that almost cost you you re life mate Might be time to step up the recovery game ,opiates
0,0,0,0,None,No clinic is going to treat you with methadone for Kratom addiction This is a terrible idea and would be dangerous as well The smallest dose of methadone can be fatal to a non opiate tolerant person While you may think you have a tolerance to opiates because of your Kratom use it s no where near enough to take methadone Try tapering using loperamide DXM in small doses CBD or weed and OTC painkillers like Tylenol and Motrin Loperamide is an opiate that binds to opiate receptors in the gut It s very helpful for mild withdrawals DXM in small doses can also help with mild withdrawals You can beat this it won t even be as bad as withdrawals from hydrocodone or tramadol ,opiate
0,0,0,0,None,Methadone is a sinthetic opiate that s very pure not like heroin It harms so much as any other opiate specially the liver his most damaged organ I didn t get to know him but I know that he was a great person Married and with a son and a daughter who cried very much for him as his brother My friend loves all of his siblings but he was his favourite brother He told me that he was really strong and that he never saw him ill not even a cold I felt so much this loss and I felt very guilty for being consuming heroin and for going to start to use methadone soon He will be always remembered Nah it s not overdose what I m worried about it s just getting too high so everybody realices it forgetting my things at the train I already forgot a bag being sober at the station someone just told me getting distracted so I don t realice it s my stop I think mine is the last one or losing the strength to take my luggage out the train it s only taking it down and crossing the trains door honestly and people already helped me to put it up so Lol you re right it probably won t happen anything bad and already an hour has passed and I m not caring very much I ll just start picking up my things some time before arriving as I did on the previous train Thanks man I m going back to drink my chocolate milk ,opiate^chocolate

1,1,1,1,None,Thanks for your response The vocal Suboxone users seem to generally agree that it s a nasty medication and if effective should be used for the minimum amount of time The reason I can t just quickly taper to a stop and attempt sobriety without an aide is because I ve tried that multiple times There is nothing that has kept me from relapsing eventually I hope you find lasting sobriety but if I were in your shoes I would eventually continue my addiction and the things involved with it secrecy money morning withdrawals other substances etc Suboxone has given me stability inspite of its side effects However it has not eliminated cravings or treated my anxiety depression like traditional opioids did I m hoping I can learn coping mechanisms for the cravings and treat my underlying anxiety depression while the Suboxone keeps me stable If Suboxone is partially satiating my opioid receptors to keep me from continuing the patterns of substsnce abuse then it seems it has its value I want someone to say that they discovered they were able to partially heal and then established a better baseline for working toward full sobriety at the end of Suboxone treatment To be at a better starting point then when going straight to sobriety without a Suboxone transition I don t feel intense dullness or suicidal thoughts from the medication I don t feel good either I feel my old negative sober feelings but at like 50 The 50 is giving me enough stamina to continue resisting the patterns of substance abuse It still feels like work but I might be headed toward a better final outcome Are you equipped now to stay sober for the rest of your life Please update the community with your progress and good luck Again thank you for your response ,opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Kratom is illegal in my state I have no experience with the black or grey market so I wouldn t be sure how to get some Plus I ve read that kratom will only prolong withdrawals I ve also read the opposite though so I have no idea what to believe This is why I made this post there is so much conflicting information out there I am on day 4 of withdrawals For some reason I feel worse today than yesterday I ve been in discomfort and pain for 4 days and I m desperate for relief My habit was around the equivalent of 40 50 mg of hydrocodone though I took all kinds of different pills when I was actively using then I got on suboxone for a month and managed to taper down to 5 mg Suboxone was ruining my life causing me depression anhedonia and suicidal thoughts so I jumped off that onto extended release morphine I rapidly tapered down to 15 mg of morphine and my last dose was last Wednesday I honestly thought withdrawals would be getting significantly better by now based on my experience quitting in the past I have work and appointments to go to starting tomorrow and I don t know how I m going to do it The restlessness and the leg and back pain are terrible but what really getting to me is the sweats I m either far too hot or shivering from cold there is no in between I ve sweated through 3 pairs of sheets and 2 comforters in three days Wearing clothing makes me too hot but taking it off immediately sends goosebumps and shivers shooting through my entire body I know just one 30 mg codeine pill would make everything so much better at this point But I ve come this far without taking anything yet still it s calling to me Screaming to me at times I can t figure out whether making things better for me now will make it that much worse tomorrow I only have 2 30 mg codeines left plus a couple of 50 mg tramadols so I wouldn t be able to totally relapse on what I have and I no longer have any access to any other opiates I just want this to be over Edit Apologies for the essay withdrawals make me desperate to talk and talk and talk Thank you for sharing your experience So my issue is that I need to be functioning and back to work and such by Tuesday but preferably Monday That s why it s very important I don t take anything to prolong the worst withdrawal symptoms I have managed to quit opiates a couple times before and my withdrawals only lasted about 3 days I have actually had no problems with diarrhea or nausea this whole time which makes me think my withdrawal must be much less intense than it could have been and gives me hope that it will end soon Perhaps tapering down with the suboxone is what did the trick So instead of withdrawing from a 50 mg or so hydrodcodone habit hopefully I m withdrawing from the 5 mg suboxone instead It s really just the pain all over the constant discomfort and the restless legs that are getting to me and making me crave pills But even if Imodium will help that now I don t want to take it if it s going to prolong these symptoms to any extent ,black^opiates
0,0,0,0,None,I hate to say it but you re probably looking at closer to 6 months to reset your tolerance and even at that I don t know if you ll ever go back to using it as prescribed Maybe you can but in my honest opinion it s highly unlikely I would look at ordering Kratom online or considering Suboxone However Suboxone might not be enough for your pain The best course is to try to get off opiates altogether Taking 15 30 day no matter your pain level is addictive behavior Talk to your doctor about exploring other options for pain management Best wishes ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,Reality checks are merely statistical probabilities for becoming lucid in dreams not guarantees You flip light switches in real life making a habit of doing it all the time even better if its exaggerated i e every time you flip a light switch you do it a few times in a row Therefore when you re dreaming you re more likely to be in a situation where you flip a light switch Heres where the statistical probability comes into play It won t work every time but it s not supposed to The goal is to have it happen enough that eventually you flip a switch in your dream and then the light ultimately acts funny e g you turn it off but the light only goes dim instead of dark or you turn it on and the light is only dim instead of bright And even then you aren t guaranteed to become lucid But you do it because there s a decent chance you will e g hmm this light is weird holy shit I m literally dreaming right now Lucid dreaming is a skill and the more you practice techniques to initiate lucidity the more you increase the potential that you ll become lucid And that s also why you want to practice as many reality checks as you can to increase your chances from as many angles as possible If you re dreaming and not in a scenario with light switches obviously that reality check won t be applicable and thus you d have to hope for a chance for another reality check that is accessible counting fingers looking twice at a clock etc By this logic literally near everything you do supports war inequality or general injustice So way to go your philosophy actively frames all human beings as pieces of shit just for the mere crime of living and participating in society the economy just in general You think you aren t supporting bad shit when you put gas in your car or buy food from your marketplace Somewhere along the chain you are It s a grim reality that we all face Also the moral burden here isn t on people buying weed from the black market It s on the government for illegalizing drugs and therefore creating a black market in the first place If you don t buy the weed from your friend Joe someone else will so the wheel turns whether you engage with it or not You re essentially advocating a boycott on the black market for a moral superiority without realizing that boycotts are theoretically ineffective Ignoring issues is just as bad What are you doing personally to stop the war on drugs Check for blood on your own hands if you re not doing shit For me it was traumatic because of how anxious I was If I didn t find my class on time I dreaded the thought of catching up on missed work walking in late and it being awkward potentially going to the wrong class etc And it became real because it actually happened to where I didn t find a class in time So that just formed into a recurring anxiety that creeps back up in my dreams At least that s my best guess Yes that s a less successful reality check but it s definitely viable My friend kept a totam in his pocket for two weeks after seeing Inception because he got interested in lucid dreams due to the movie and our following conversations about lucid dreaming He had a lucid dream after that time due to the totem He dreamed that he had it in his pocket and he messed with it and it didn t act physically normal so he became momentarily lucid after recognizing the abnormality was because he was actually dreaming ,dreams^black
0,0,0,0,None,Before going to China I ve heard of the Chinese cock being small and I m sure everyone has at some point I wasn t really on the habits of sword fights so I could care less if they had a small chapstick for a dick But as soon as I got there something I wasn t ready for happened Something that really blew my mind at first got me curious and then finally started getting me angry Chinese were curious to want to see what a black cock looks like in real life Gay and straight male and female old and young Everyone literally wanted to have a peak at it That curiosity had no boundaries no shame and not even a peak to be honest Some of the things that have happened to me in China regarding my cock are just too fucking weird to even post here I m sure I ll have to post this in multiple communities before it gets a pass for posting or else it will just be a hidden story from all Anyways starts in my first week in China I ve been to Beijing before but now I was there for an indefinite amount of time I was staying with a friend but I d have to find an apartment anytime soon I ve heard that it could be tough to get an apartment there this is another post by itself btw On this particular day my friend takes me to this bar around an area called Santorum which is a shopping area mostly Beijing night life for me is a bit dull And other cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou have a more appeasing night life than Beijing s For some reason Chinese like to drink their beer warm I hate that and it gets your belly bloated Other alcohol you have to drink at your own risk as most liquor is fake bootlegged Unless you drink Chinese wine that s a bit disgusting You know counterfeit is a big problem when you start smoking Marlboro s coming from North Korea not shitting you Another thing I hate about warm beer is that it makes you want to pee at least for me it dies that So after the second beer I went to go pee The yolo okey was where they had like 4 5 stalls and I chose to take the middle one as all of them were empty Thats when the weirdest shit happens I don t know where they came from but all of a sudden all the stalls were occupied I said normal and didn t give it much thought continues doing my thing But then I kind of sensed someone behind me and then I turned around There s a fucking dude trying to look at my penis from behind me Then I also notice all four of them were actually trying to see what my cock looked like I was shocked and I said WTF ARE YOU DOING I was actually pretty mad but who wouldn t be You have 5 guys staring at your cock and talking loudly in Chinese by now I repeated wtf are you doing One of the guys poorly spoke English and he said we want to see black penis hahaha and he said it like it was a normal request As if like I was gonna feel sorry for his curiousity and drop my pants to be examined by 5 Chinese guys in a toilet at some random bar I just said you guys are stupid but I don t think they understood me as they were caught up in their conversation which I m sure was stilll about my cock I didn t even finish pissing but i has to leave cuz that made me uncomfortable I told my friend who was also black everything that happened and started cracking up He was like I should ve told you about that it always happens And even told me that I ll have to get used to it if I wanted to survive in China I knew it was gonna be a problem but him associating it with survival sounded absurd Case 2 I m in Shenzhen Beautiful city great night life and I wished I had lived there to be honest Shenzhen is the electronic of China FYI I went to Shenzen from Guangzhou with a group of friends for a weekend of partying Sunday morning I wake up early and everyone is sleeping We had a pretty long night and every one didn t look like they were gonna wake up anytime soon So i decided to buy something from shenzen electronic city and all I googled where the nearest mall around me was and I grabbed a taxi and go there I I reached the place and I m walking in and from behind I could two older ladies talking loud shouting actually Then they started shouting u you I turned around and they re obviously calling me I stopped for them They re obviously in their 60s short and very loud Typical Chinese old woman as you d expect One of the older ladies holds my arms and without even acknowledging me they re still talking I m still trying to be nice 60 year olds Then one of them takes out 200yuan and starts talking in chinese and I said NO CHINESE Then she started pointing at my penis area and making a binocular sign WTF WTF Did I just get offered 200yuan to show my penis I said what Now both are doing it pointing towards my dick and binoculars When they hailed at me I expected rude but not this Not this at all I couldn t help but laugh But I said sorry sorry and I left the two old women who were trying to lay me for a peak WEIRD OLD BITCHES Case3 I rented an apartment and there was a shop underneath and one time I got condoms from there and surprise surprise They didn t fit Chinese condoms are small Very small You d have a bloated dick after all the action Sorry for the graphics but that shit is true I told the shop owner about this using my translator app and he laughed so hard that he made a phone all hole I was shopping there and he started laughing loudly on the phone I had a feeling the conversation was about me So the next time I go to the shop The guy and his friends were there and they started laughing at me Not in bullying way but it just made me uncomfortable as hell So then dude takes out a package and says YOU YOU And he gives me DUREX XXL condoms Idk where the hell he found XXL comdoms in China but I was really surprised But as much as I d like to write saying I used them all in a day XXL can fit my elbows let alone my dick I told him too big then like he was saying really and starts trying to grab and feel my cock and laughing out loud with his friends backing him up I just left the shop pissed Case 4 I am trying to hook up with a chinese girl Girl started liking me but there s something holding her back I knew what it was but I will say there was something holding her back Then after a night out she says Promise me that If we have sex I ll not go to hospital She said I know about black penis and I m chinese I could die I ve never seen it as a cock of destruction but I promised her nothing of that sort will happen Not going to write the sex stuff but the aftermath sorry We started sort of like being serious and then I started noticing a trend with her She s love to come to the house she s love to go a bar that is dark but she wouldn t want to be seen with me at day time At first it didn t bother me but it gets to you Like what the fuck I didn t do shit So I asked and she said it was coincidence and nothing if that sort happened Then she eventually started going out with me at daytime but I also started noticing people on the streets would point at us shamelessly and start talking in Chinese I asked her and she said it s not about us and that they re talking about random things Whatever language it is you will know when somebody talks about you and I insisted for so many says that she tell me It happened everytime so it was getting annoying too Then she tells me almost crying the reason I don t like to be seen with you is because of people say about you and me she said that black guy has destroyed her pussy now there s no way she can be satisfied with a chinese penis now her oust must be so wide probably inserts a chinese mans head his dick probably reaches his knees blah blah I was like wtf my knees ,black

1,1,1,1,None,I saw a UFO with my friend one time and it scared us both very badly we couldn t believe what we were seeing We got lost in the woods when we were bow fishing on the river and followed all the tributaries for a few miles and forgetting which direction we came from or where we were We had the idea of There is a train that comes through here let s just wait until we hear it and go in that direction and follow it one way until it hits the road and we can find our car if we go the wrong way we will know sooner or later and just walk opposite we were entirely lost and that was literally our only option because it was becoming night time and both of our phones were dead and we didn t even have a lighter to smoke our pot or cigarettes that part sucked Anyways so we had been following tributaries or streams forever thinking we would figure out where we were but realistically just getting more lost We heard the train when it was almost night time so we ran in that direction and found a road after seeing some headlights before we ever found tracks We were exhausted and it was great because we could see all the way down because it was farmland a house The car had been going the opposite direction leaving the house so too scared to go up to the house we were in the middle of nowhere and had seen multiple no trespassing signs so we were scared to let anyone see us and ask where we were we just followed the way the car we saw was driving On one side of us was the woods that we had just come out of and on the other was a flat plain of farmland all the way to the horizon there was literally nothing there The sun was almost all the way down but it wasn t quite dark yet there were stars in the sky We saw plain as daylight this invisible triangular craft hovering about 50 feet off the ground only about 300 feet or so away from us And this thing was huge We could make it out because there were three lights they basically looked like stars all connected by this black in color but almost like a mirror craft we could see the color of the sky behind it and stars reflecting off of it It was almost like it was invisible but we could make it out because of the three lights It made no noise and the front light would change in its intensity of brightness It would stay the same size these lights just looked like stars they were pin pricks of light but it would get SO bright like if we were looking into the sun and then it would dim back down to what the others looked like It was so bizarre because it stayed the same size and was randomly changing in intensity to where just the pin prick of light would become so bright that we could barely even look at it We were scared shitless I mean this thing was right in front of us and we still hang out to this day and talk about it I will probably never see something as strange and novel as that again Honestly with my personality I thought I would be curious and just walk up to this thing and investigate but seriously we were very scared of it and there was no way in hell we were walking up to that thing We kept walking and kept our eyes on it for a solid 15 minutes it just stayed silent For a brief minute or so we took our concentration off of it and were talking to each other about it then we look back and it s just gone The thing was right next to us and then when we looked back it had literally vanished I m a very skeptical person and even still if people tell me they saw a UFO I tend to not believe them or rationalize it to something else that is more realistic But this really happened to us and neither of us will ever forget it I looked up tons of things when we eventually found the main road leading to our car and drove home It fit the description entirely of these black triangle UFO sightings Before we started looking things up we did not even know that this was an actually referenced to type of UFO it spooked us out even more reading some of the stories and how similar it was to what we saw And we were reading that it probably was good we didn t walk up to it because apparently people who have have had cases of diseases caused by what they think was radiation I don t know about all that but we definitely wouldn t have walked up to the thing we had real fear going through us at the sight of that It is such a surreal memory I wouldn t call myself insane If you took an opiate such as hydrocodone in its pure form once a week for 5 years and tylenol at 1000mg once a week for 5 years the tylenol would most certainly be more physically destructive than the hydrocodone I had a coworker die because he drank every night and took tylenol every morning Everyone was explicitly told that the tylenol he was taking was the absolute main cause not the alcohol and that tylenol is actually responsible for 90 of liver toxicity deaths I haven t taken a tylenol in ten years It is literally just poison and the multiple gram dosage to even try to get rid of a headache which barely even works is very much not good for you Why it is the 1 doctor recommended pain reliever is beyond me You re literally better off taking an opiate for your pain as far as physical health goes Of course they tend to pump those full of acetominophen as well I do not know how much more healthy ibupofen or naproxen sodium is but in extreme cirumstances I will take naproxen sodium I have basically convinced myself that it works better because of it working with the NMDA receptors Also kratom although the opioid effect for whatever reason won t get away headaches however is a miracle for the pain I experience from breaking my pelvis in two places after a near fatal car accident They were giving me 60mg oxycodone per day along with a lot of tylenol which I then had no choice but for my body to become physically dependent on Thank god for kratom it is healthier than naproxen sodium in my mind Even got all sorts of medical tests done a few years later and have had

0,0,0,0,None,I was in a school shooting I was at lunch and heard a pow And I seen a girl that was about 20 feet to my left fall to the ground We had some lunch tables that are outside in the courtyard and it was at the end of lunch so we were all standing around in the courtyard I knew the girl that fell down she was a really strange girl that was pretty quiet all the time When it happened a few people walked over and checked on her but most people just kind of looked for a few seconds and shrugged it off The gun that she was shot with was a 22 caliber rifle so it wasn t too awful loud We had a habit of twisting water bottles up and popping off the lids at people and that s what I though happened I thought someone shot a water bottle lid at her and scared her I started slowly walking over to her and seen blood just pouring out of her neck Once people realized what happened everyone started running inside and within 2 minutes the school was put on a red alert People were crying and super freaked out Teachers were crying it was crazy I ended up going to the principles office with about 50 other students during the code red as we were told to go to the nearest room and get down on the ground We were in there for about an hour before SWAT showed up and escorted every student out of the school and searched every student on their way out I remember they all were wearing masks I remember walking down the hallway and it being covered in lighters dip cans and cigarette packs from people just throwing their stuff down so they wouldn t get caught We were escorted next door to the middle school where our parents picked us up I remember helicopters flying around over us as we walked to the middle school in a single file line with our hands on our heads We found out the next day who the shooter was He was a black guy who was super calm and friendly I had a class with him and played on his football team a few years back Super nice guy I found out the true story of why it happened There was a black girl in our lunch that got her 2 brothers to beat up the school shooter about a week before this all happened and he brought a small 22 rifle to school and was going to shoot her Not even sure how he managed to get a 22 rifle into the school but he did I think it was a cricket 22 Small single shot kids 22 rifle Well he left class to use the bathroom got the gun and went up to the second story on the breezeway and was trying to shoot the girl who s brothers beat him up and accidentally shot an innocent person by accident in the neck It s crazy because I was actually in the line of fire as I was standing about 20 feet behind the girl who got shot She ended up living but if I recall was paralyzed from the waist down Super sad situation I think he got 25 years for it Some people were really messed up from it happening it didn t really bother me to be honest We had to go through metal detectors and Had K9 dogs at school everyday for the rest of the year though ,black
0,0,0,0,None,You re right in almost any other case but when it comes to the black vote over 30 it s pretty much all Biden Is it for a broad spectrum of reasons that a very specific demographic overwhelmingly supports a historically weak candidate No chance It s because older and middle aged black voters are most familiar with the urgency of keeping racism out of government and to older voters of all races Joe Biden is perceived as supremely electable That of course will change as he proceeds to lose the first two contests Being black has nothing to do with it He described himself as a moderate conservative and that s all you need to know to explain the character of his presidency ,black

0,0,0,0,None,No problem The primary difference between drugs like etizolam Xanax and diazepam and drugs like Phenibut is that the former bind to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAa receptor and modulate GABA transport to occur more frequently while the latter inhibits calcium channels and actually has no direct influence on GABA Phenibut being an exception as it binds to the GABAb receptor I have no idea if kindling has anything to do with gabapentin wd sensitivity but given that the pentin s have inhibitory effects similar to GABA it s not too far fetched to think so Kindling is usually discussed in the context of opioid drugs and GABAa b agonists modulators but is likely involved in most systems A good example to look at when trying to understand kindling is binge drinking Binge drinking is actually more damaging than consistent alcoholism to an extent because when withdrawing from alcohol your now uninhibited glutamate levels SKYROCKET While glutamate is important for normalizing your receptors it can also damage important neurological systems and worsen receptor uncoupling loss of receptors Repeating this process over and over again leads to more damage unbalance and uncoupling making you far more sensitive to withdrawals and damage from alcohol Well kinda So to start alcohol is poorly understood from a pharmacological standpoint but is believed to mediate its effects through GABA In any case ethanol has long shown a similarity in its effects to positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor like benzodiazepines barbiturates and various general anesthetics 19 52 Indeed ethanol has been found to enhance GABAA receptor mediated currents in functional assays 19 52 In accordance it is theorized and widely believed that the primary mechanism of action is as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator With regard to opioid drugs a study on kindling can be found here https www ncbi nlm nih gov m pubmed 7200381 The TLDR is that opioid kindling exists but does not have much application to your original question Now I can t find any studies on the existence of gabapentinoid kindling Phenibut Gabapentin etc however from reading countless anecdotes on reddit I ve found that people who abused and then cold turkey d Phenibut experience a very similar phenomenon Besides the sometimes horrid ct withdrawals with similar symptoms to alcohol wd they seem to experience significant post acute withdrawal symptoms for months following abstinence whereas people who tapered slowly do not often experience PAWS Additionally those who abused and wd d from Phenibut report that even years later they re unable to feel the magic that they once did after dosing Phenibut The existence of PAWS and blunted effects upon relapse suggest long term or even permanent changes to brain chemistry following withdrawal something we ve partially connected to the kindling phenomenon in benzodiazepines Moreover this phenomenon is predominantly found in users who did not taper and or experienced severe withdrawals which indicates that a mechanism similar to the glutamate rebound found in Benzos may be occurring To answer your last question it s both People like to explain tolerance and withdrawal through receptor down regulation when in reality that s likely not the case The only evidence supporting that theory is from animal studies using incredibly high doses which fails to explain how nightly use of a normal dose of a short acting benzodiazepine produces dependence So with alcohol following an episode of heavy binge drinking a 4 5 fold increase in glutamate release occurs That much glutamate causes neuronal cell death brain damage and neuronal destruction Specifically the withdrawals change AMPA receptors a type of glutamate receptors in areas of the brain that control anxiety and seizure threshold making that person more susceptible to anxiety and seizures Repeating this process over and over again progressively makes the withdrawals worse more anxiety seizures This is likely the primary mechanism behind neuronal kindling ,opioid

1,1,1,1,None,Ketamine fucked me up as well I only used for 2 years but It was 2 3 grams each day I once ordered 50gs from a website forgot I ordered it I was high woke up to a package I had to sign for and went on a bender that last 2 days and I went through 18gs Gave the rest to a friend and quit I ve used over 150 different drugs and ketamine MXE to an extent as well had me hook line and sinker I ve even had opium lying around I ve managed to use a few times a month with no issues but ketamine just had me in it s grips unlike anything else I ever tried I m around 8 1 2 9 years off now The only way I got sober is when the whole country went dry around 9 years ago My dealer only really sold to me by the end Didnt help they lived in a flat beneath me I still get a funky feeling bladder every now and again and I will never forget the bladder gallbladder spasms that usedd to have me curled up in pain for 6 hours at a time Heroin and opiates generally are not so amazing that you really want to take it again minus IV maybe I ve done probably half an O of heroin over the years and only once had minor withdrawals The thing with them though is there s no hangover or comedown If you don t IV your quite likely to think whats all the fuss about The problem is the high grows on you and it totally relieves any amount of anxiety you have I use opium at max once a week and have done for 8 years with only 2 bouts of minor withdrawal after 3 4 days of use in the first year After going through that first opium tea withdrawal I knew not to get addicted to it again and it s been a sunday treat for me for years now When I feel that psychological addiction starting to take hold I take a few months off and I have at least a week off every month that I do do it so 3 4 sundays of the month I ll use Also when I run out of poppies I take a few months off It s nt impossible to use opiates reasonably but I think it get s a lot harder when it comes to IVing Also PPT is a bit of a pain to prepare unlike racking up a line or prepping IV IIRC only 20 of recreational opiate users end up being problematic users Funny thing is thoughh I ve had plenty of addictions to other drugs but opiates scare me a little because of the physical aspect of the addiction KEtamine for example absolutely hooked me hook line and sinker I used to IM ketamine so I know how much more addictive the needle is compared to other ROAs Still wouldnt suggest recreational opiate use to anyone though but it s not quite like it s made out Most drugs have limited physical withdrawal effects outside of opiates and downers like alcohol benzos I ve been taking opioid 2 3 times a month for around 6 years with only having a mild WD once but I smoked cannabis for 15 years daily I can have opiates lying around because I know they are physically addictive and that is a trigger for me to take a break Because weed doesn t present many WD symptoms and doesn t impact you to the point of not being functioning it s almost a more insideous addiction because you believe everything is fine and it s not a problem I m pretty sure a lot of people who claim it has no negative effects have just not tried being sober for a while and don t want to quit I do 100 get rebound REM nightmares and sweats when I quit though Weed 100 has withdrawal effect they re just not that bad and honestly physical addition isn t nearly as bad as a psychological addition anyway so people saying it s only psychological and nothing to be worried about are kidding themselves It s fine to smoke weed but it s not a cure all harmless drug like a lot of people like to believe and this is coming from someone who has always loved cannabis It s not the devil drug that a lot of people believe either and has a lot of benefits but also has numerous drawbacks if it s overused Everything has its price even weed IME I find it easy if I haven t got it but abstaining if I do isn t as easy It stresses me out for a day or two and gives me bizzare dreams for a week or more I Used and abused most types of drugs and cannabis seems to be the most forgiving but long term heavy use isn t without some risks and there is a WD period to it it s just minor in comparison to most other drugs A lot of people think of cannabis as being a perfect drug with no negative effects which isn t the whole story either and will dismiss the fact that a weed smoker can also be an addict and experience problems stopping Definitely less addictive than opiates Opiates are just really easy to use all the time because you can pretty much function without impairment They are kind of like the perfect drug for any time I would say alcohol is much worse to come off though from my experience with mild GHB and benzo addiction Alcohol isn t exactly easy to get addicted to if your in a good place in your life You have to be hammering it for years really and the hangover becomes a pain in the ass when you get older Opiates though your tolerance can build pretty quickly especially if you have any history of use This is the closest thing I ve heard in regards to the how and why of opiate addiction https www youtube com watch v 9huWlXFA1s I m not really a fan of Shapiro but I don t get the hate monger thing either From what I can see he just has a different viewpoint to the left but he gives his reasoning and it doesn t seem based in bias I like Peterson as well and really struggle with most of reddit twitters view of him as well I can see how people can take short clips out of context but I don t see most of the issues that he s always critiques for After watching his classes and lectures his view is a lot more nuanced than people are willing to believe I think it s the you must agree with me or your a bad person polarization that the internet seems to foster There is no more grey just different shades of black and white I got into weed because my friend gave me hash cake when I was 14 It went from smoking weed to pretty much everything else when I turned 18 Ketamine was my first real drug addiction though that stuff really got me hook line and sinker Got over the ketamine and continued to use a plethora of different drugs an RCs At some point during my K addiction I developed a benzo habit which ruined me slowly and took 18 months to fully get over after 10 months of abuse Do not abuse benzos it s so not worth it Mostly sober these days although I am drinking some opium at the moment Turns out I was self medicating ADHD and since I have been prescribed Ritalin then my cravings have dropped through the floor and I can control my drug use which is a strange feeling I m not really a Data Analyst even though I do spend a fair amount of time doing that these days I work in the education sector in a small business delivering work based learning We ve grown over the 12 years I ve been there so we re 10x the size so my role went from managing small networks to helping scale and redesign what and how we do things I do some systems admin but that s mostly down to the MSP we have on hand I tend to do things like powershell scripting to automate the creation of learners from one system to another I support my boss on a lot of BI stuff because he knows what we need and enough of PBI to get the job done and I fill in when he s struggling with the DAX or SQL or just figuring out how best to do what he says we need I also setup and maintain our SQL database that pulls datasets from different sources and standardizes the data into it s own structure so any changes or additional fields we need I need to write the SQL to automate from our hosted DB shared in between a few companies so it s off site and to import locally after transferring VIA FTP all automated I do spend a fair bit of time maintaining training laptops or doing tech support if the MSP cannot fix the issues We had one issue where OneDrive wasn t displaying anything in the online version and I had to troubleshoot after MS support couldn t fix it that required me brushing up on the client side object model to generate a new view since the functionality isn t in the GUI Knowing that OneDrive is

do to grow further I m kind of a jack of all trades when it comes to IT which is pretty common to be honest when it comes to Small Businesses and IT If your generally interested in IT then a small business is the place for you as long as your quick enough to learn whatever you need to in relatively short notice periods It keeps you fresh but it can also wear you down If you want to specialize in something then a bigger business is where you want to be because they are unlikely to have a few people doing everything If your interested in data science some things you can do is web scraping using beautiful soup for python You can essentially turn any website into an API with web scraping which means anything on the WWW can be your dataset I had done some python courses in data analysis on courser a few years that was a pretty good intro into the whole field I have the book the course was based on here in front of me called Python for informatics Exploring information if your interested PowerBI is a lot easier to churn out the dashboards though so you focus more on getting the right data instead of coding the whole thing out I am hoping to look into the AI models that are common in python though once we finish V1 of the dashboards Good luck If you ever need a chat drop me a PM I was more talking about the everyone has nightmares therefor it s not the weed comment All I m saying is there are negative effects from quitting recreational drugs and everyone is different Also that because it s psychological and not physical doesn t necessarily mean that s any better The most damaging addiction I had was to ketamine and that s not generally seen as an addictive drug to most people The drug I abused most was probably weed because it seems so innocuous but the full range of it s effects were not really clear to me until I stopped using for a good while and went back such as how it can heighten anxiety Most drugs are not physically addictive in the way benzos or opiates are but most drugs will present some physical sings of withdrawal if they are used long enough Ahh that sucks but I can see it happening even if a lot will say it s all in your head As I got older weed seemed to go from doesn t effect me whatsoever to I have to be pretty careful with it It seems to cause me anxiety if I overuse these days whereas I used to be able to just smoke through it I still can but I don t want to force myself into an anxious state for the sake of it I struggle with insomnia and depression so I know how those feels Funnily enough since I cut down on my smoking and got off benzos it s so much better I always thought weed was helping and it kind of did but turns out I was medicating unmedicated ADHD which was a cause of my sleep disorder and unhappy disposition I m of the belief that most heavy drug users self medicate to some extent so if your still in that lifestyle try and get it under control Quitting benzos was the hardest thing I ve done but it eventually made a lot of my anxiety related issues go down to basically non existent Weed really helps me sleep which is one of the reasons I wish I could have a bit lying around so I can smoke just before bed but it always without fail leads me to smoking more and more through the day I went from a pipe a night to 3 5gs a day within a week last time I tried that It s such a strange drug when it comes to addiction I wouldn t call it addictive in the sense opiates or cocaine are but because for most people the WD is minimal it makes it way too easy to abuse and if you keep it up over years then you essentially forget what being sober and having a clear mind is like I need to find a good hash dealer because I m not really a massive fan of the super strength high thc weed everyone seems to love I much prefer a good amount of CBD to level out the THC and I never get anxious from hash Try hash if you can it helped me cut down massively Went from smoking 3 5gs a day to using a pipe to cut out tobacco and eventually moved to hash and since I done that I no longer feel the need to always have therefor always smoke it lying around and I can take it or leave it these day mostly Ye but it only happens after I stop smoking It s not a coincidence I ve been smoking it for 15 years and only a few years started taking regular breaks What your saying is like saying to an opiate addict that it s not withdrawal everyone is sick and sweats at some point not related at all or telling a benzo addict that it s all in their head and not physical just because the major symptoms are anxiety My mother had metal plates in her back and some sort of metal brace along with shaving parts of her spine off 6 Months recovery time and to start off they gave her apap and ibuprofen This is in the UK not the US Had to tell my old man how ridiculous that is for an op like that I get none for minor operations but she was in terrible pain for weeks even after she finally got some tramadol It s like they only want to give them to terminal cancer patients and even then their pretty strict I get opiates are addictive but they are the gold standard for pain relief for a reason Even then you could solve the addiction in most cases with a quick sub taper after the pain eases off Shes pushing 60 and never had any addiction issues in the past ,opium^opiates^dreams^opiate^black
0,0,0,0,None,You make an interesting point But I don t think the abolitionism shift was quite as sudden and as complete as you make it out to be First of all it didn t happen overnight and as you know there was a civil war in the US and it still continued in an institutional form right up until the civil rights movement which was less than a century ago Second we are nowhere close to eradicating slavery Africa basically still has slavery They might use different words for it or they might not call it anything at all but it still exists and it s rampant Cambodia still has actual and very literal child slavery China has perhaps the most polished and politically sugar coated form of slavery but it s still essentially slavery Just because a person is not in chains doesn t mean that their whole life isn t owned and controlled by a government or a group of powerful individuals Which brings me to your original point I don t think there s going to be a paradigm shift or some kind of catharsis of the grand consciousness of humanity I think we will slowly get to Oppenheimer s vision as technology gets us to the point where we eradicate scarcity The day that no man woman or child anywhere in this world has to worry about food water electricity education and internet is the day that we will begin to stop fighting wars At least the way I see it everyone will eventually get to somewhere on the spectrum from apathetic to happy and there will be nothing left to fight for People will either pursue meaningful activities like reading sports and the arts or they will entertain themselves to death Dictatorship will fall out of fashion because everyone will have whatever they want and people will just calm down and plug into their VR sets and ignore all the bullshit Armies will dissolve and governments will take on more of a passive role as human needs reach a kind of global equilibrium But we re talking about 500 years in my opinion I don t buy into the singularity hype so much I just had a dream that I was writing my dreams down into a red journal called the Reb Book I was almost finished but I ran out of ink But I had already written down the dreams in my dream for that date It was Tue 5th 7 12th or something It didn t make any sense But I just remember the numbers Tue 2 5 7 12 Then I woke up I could remember the dream and I started writing it down in my actual dream journal My actual dream journal is not red and it s not called the Red Book possibly because I m not Carl Jung but I m not sure So as soon I started writing down the dream I couldn t remember the dreams that I had written down within my dream All I remember was there was one static image and 3 dynamic dreams that each had a past and a future scene So one and three pairs that is 1 3 3 I could remember them all more or less and was juggling them in my ephemeral short term memory but as soon as I went to write them down they vanished You know how dreams just vanish from your memory as soon as you wake up unless you catch them Well I thought I caught them but I only caught the dream not the dreams within the dream I ve been trying to relax and mediate and let them come back to me but I don t think it s happening Slippery slopes Glass houses with glass ceilings Like a bull in a China shop Actions are louder than words The pen is mightier than the sword Buddy ,china^dreams

1,1,1,1,None,This is actually slightly true Kratom contains opioid agonists AND antagonists This is why redosing kratom doesn t work well until it wears off Because of this if you take kratom before other opioids it will dampen the effects But they don t cancel each other out If you take your other opioids first your receptors will sort of get saturated then you can take the kratom about an hour later and you ll be good to go Opiates cause histamine release which often can lead to nausea among other things Nicotine can also cause nausea so I d guess your body just isn t a fan of the two in conjunction Gabapentin is nice I used it to ease benzo w d process earlier this month It kind of feels like a stimulating opiate Take 300mg every 30 45min with a tablespoon of peanut butter and drink some soda 1800mg was a nice spot IMO Didn t feel much cross tolerance from benzos but I was only using them for a year ,opioid^opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None,What is wrong with being an atheist agnostic I disagree that faith can fix the opioid crisis I m not trying to start anything that s just my two cents SPOILERS I agree with this poster He writes whatever He wants to Op are you saying you didn t enjoy San Junipero Imo that was one of the best episodes of Black Mirror Also as this poster is saying there are only so many bad endings you can write I have always loved this show for being as dark as it is Having an occasional good ending mixes things up San Junipero was incredible I also loved Hang the Dj It s more about twists imo Yes most episodes are dark and bleak but even the lighter episodes have awesome twists It did become more Americanized and I was concerned that it would affect the show in a bad way but imo I don t think it was Yes early episodes like White Bear and White Christmas were amazing because of their dark twisted endings You re so strong to be able to quit Unfortunately patches have never helped me personally but gum did I think if I did gum and really stuck to a regiment I could be smoke free by my birthday September Anyway back to the case I agree with you that the relationship between Lisa and Michelle was more in Michelle s head It did feel like Michelle fantasizing in real time You re right that Michelle lied about a lot of things I also believe people who say they were raped but Michelle was changing her stories about that all the time She was a known liar I m a survivor and sometimes you convince yourself that X happened so you don t feel as bad and then after therapy you realize Y happened I m not saying she was raped and I always believe the survivor I m saying you have a really good point about her changing her story and then saying it didn t happen at all As far as Lisa goes I think she did have feelings for her but they were one sided I think you re right about why Lisa s mother cut off their friendship It seems like Michelle could be a pathological liar to get attention such as saying Conrad raped her and then saying they got to third base I know we ve discussed this a lot but despite her lying issues I do think that her confession was true We don t have to discuss it You have your opinion and I have mine and honestly we will never know who s right Conrad did have a history of multiple suicide attempts I think if Michelle has called his mom things would be much different today I don t know why he wasn t institutionalized He should have been put in a residential program like I was I m not saying it s his family s fault at all but they should ve looked into residentials My family was able to get the state to pay because it was too expensive But they didn t do it alone The therapeutic day school I went to helped them contact the right people I was like Conrad as a teenager My last suicide attempt was using my mom s back pills OxyContin and norco plus Valium and dilation I was already in residential but it was abusive After that attempt I was put in a room that was empty for 6 months I wasn t allowed clothes or anything else I d understand maybe a month But 6 There s so much I could say but this isn t about me It wasn t because they were worried it was because the therapist took it personally Thankfully Jewish children s services investigated and saw proof of emotional abuse such as 3 hour sessions monitored phone calls and when I couldn t tell my parents how bad it was I wrote letters which were intercepted It gave me ptsd and I had physically painful nightmares for years Sorry to go off I do think Conrad would ve benefited from a good residential treatment facility I think his mom was so surprised because he was doing well outwardly I absolutely agree about the Glee connection It sounds crazy that there was one but when you look at things Michelle said after Cory Montieth died it is very clear there was a connection I think she follow his death and Lea Michelle s words obsessively I remember when Chris Benoit died and what he did My brother was a big WWE fan and he was really upset after it happened I wasn t into wrestling but I was upset after it happened It was total tragedy I definitely agree with you She wanted to be Lea Michelle She wanted to be the woman who had the dead boyfriend but was strong through out it all Maybe she did want to be a singer actress or maybe she just wanted the attention I agree with you She became more insistent the closer it came to the anniversary of Cory s death She did also mention contemplating Conrad s death after Cory died I really enjoy talk to you about what happened between Michelle and Conrad and how Michelle factored into his death Oh I can definitely relate to that I ve known people in my life who had schadenfreude when I was struggling It s messed up Trying to get you to start smoking again are the fucking worst It s hard enough to quit I ve tried many times and it is so hard You re stronger than me to be able to quit Just a side question how did you quit The gum helps but it s more about me being able to toughen up when it gets hard I agree with you about Michelle being bisexual I figured even if something did happen with that girl her mother and her would NEVER admit it I don t think it was only because that girl may have been bisexual and her mother who maybe didn t know and they wanted it to be a secret it to look like Michelle was a crazy sociopath who would say anything for attention I agree she had issues with being dramatic and wanting attention but I do believe she had genuine feelings for that girl I think her name was Lisa I didn t know his death was on the anniversary of Cory montieth s death I think that could explain her extreme insistence that he do it as soon as possible I also know that people who ve made up their mind about ending their life usually will do so However her insistence seemed to make him less sure and actually going through with it I know we will probably disagree on this one point but I think he could ve been helped I do think Cory Montieth s death definitely had a huge impact on her Remember when she started saying weird things and he was like why re you saying this stuff and she just appeared to be obsessed with Cory Montieth s death and Lea Michelle that s her name right If she hadn t been the little devil whispering and sometimes yelling in his ear I think he could ve made it They should ve been kept apart If she d just texted his mother with whom she kept in contact with then there is a possibility he d be alive I m saying this with experience with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts Sometimes I d get extremely suicidal but I was like Conrad and did research When I found out that I d have to take my mom s OxyContin norco Valium and Dilantin to really do it I was ready to die Then when I woke up I tried to tell my mom I d taken pills She thought I just got high and I was taken back to the emotionally abusive residential that Jewish children s services eventually came to the conclusion that there was abuse and I was removed long story but my point being I was thought I was resigned to die but I wasn t I think if Conrad was medicated and in a partial hospitalization program or full residential then I truly think without the Michelle factor he d still be alive That s just my opinion He had tried to commit suicide but no one is beyond help imo I had a couple extremely close friends when I was dealing with my anorexia and anxiety I think she had issues with being overdramatic as well and wanted attention It was very obvious I had an ed too at 14 I got down to 87lbs at 5 5 Although the girl I thought was my bff ditched me afterwards My mom was going to take us to six flags for my birthday and then she was supposed to spend the night She called me and said she couldn t go She said doesn t your medicine make you tired And I was like what are you talking about I think she was trying to trick me into admitting I was on psych meds but I wasn t She also started saying bad things about me and openly flirting with my long term first serious love we were together for 2 years But I realized she was just jealous and started getting really close to another couple girls and then there was my real BFF he was a guy and we d been really close for years We d talk on the phone for hours and had so many inside jokes He was my bf s best friend first and then we became really close Sorry to go off on a tangent My point was it wasn t really her ed and other problems as much as she was an attention seeker and had a flair for the dramatic which would make people dislike her The relationship with the girl was mentioned in the hbo documentary Her relationship with Conrad became unhealthy almost right away She asked if they were going to get married and he asked her what was wrong She got very upset and said why WHY She got the attention she needed from him most of the time but was still a dramatic girl Yes she was intense and did lie for attention but I truly believe that she confessed to that girl months later because she felt guilty I don t think any of that text was a lie It is depressing She was the weird dramatic girl who told lies for attention and it ultimately got a guy to commit suicide I am considering her past lies and behavior when I say I think she did tell him to get in the truck and was even freaking out about getting caught I think she was spinning out because she finally realized that she was a part of her boyfriend s death Telling that girl that she told him to get back in and also saying she felt guilty but at the same time was afraid of getting in trouble It s complicated but I don t think that was a lie If she d texted it right after he died then yeah I d say lie but it was months after and she realized she was fucked When I say she grew a conscious I don t mean she became a completely different person I think she felt guilty and as far as her lack of apology or taking any responsibility well I don t think she was there She may never be there Part of her feels guilty but the most important person in her life is her and I don t think she still fully gets it I don t think she lied but I also don t think she fully comprehends what she s done She can be of two minds about it She can feel guilty but she can also feel like she didn t want to get in trouble When I said she had a lot of supporters I should ve said that there are people who think she got the raw end of the deal because she has issues I think because of how RedHanded was defending her so much that there are people out there who feel she shouldn t have been charged or that she should ve gotten more sympathy from the press As far as the press goes I think her portrayal as a black widow to a defenseless teenager is wrong She was very isolated and no publications really delved into her issues or anything At least RedHanded took a side that was totally different than others Maybe I m wrong but from what you ve told me about the podcast defending her actions so much I feel like there are people who think the bullying wasn t that bad or don t believe she ultimately pushed him over the edge That s why I loved the hbo thing It shows both sides of the argument During parts of it I did feel for her But I still think she should ve gotten more time The fact that she never took any responsibility shows that she still doesn t believe what she did was all that bad In her mind he was going to do it anyway Except when he showed any hesitation she mocked him and got mad at him It is in the document I linked You should at least read the texts I understand what you meant now about RedHanded Of course it s not as objective as a documentary I just don t know why they picked her side They read the evidence I understand though that the point of having a podcast is to share your opinion They have a right to their opinion just like we have a right to ours Even though we differ on certain things I still feel like we mostly agree I didn t know it was 11 months It s not nitpicking to correct me lol Thank you for saying that It really does mean a lot xx I just hate that I still have that itch you know the one and I need to scratch it sometimes I can t just be on my regular doses sometimes because I miss being opioids and since I don t want to really mess up I just stick to occasionally taking extra of medication I m on which isn t any better than buying it on the street imo I had the chance recently to get some oxy which I used to abuse a lot in my teens when it was still crushable lol and I knew if I did it once I mean I d have to stop taking the zubsolv first for a week which would be hell in and of itself since I ve experienced Suboxone withdrawal and it s horrible I d keep wanting more and probably go back to h which would ruin my marriage and probably land me jail or in the ground so I didn t do it At least I have that At least I know if I ever went back to opiates I d be fucked I m trying to do what you re doing and take what I m prescribed It s just really hard My life is going great right now and I still want to get high which makes me feel guilty but I know addiction is a disease and I have to take every victory no matter how small as a huge deal Sorry for the long response lol Well most drugs even ones people don t abuse like seroqual or SSRIs cause withdrawal if you suddenly stop taking them Gabapentin doesn t cause withdrawal like benzos or other gaba drugs It is more of a nuisance than torture like opiate withdrawal or benzo withdrawal Trust me I used to abuse it and run early every month Then I d get insomnia restlessness and some anxiety but it s nothing compared to benzo withdrawal which I have been through as well which causes seizures and psychosis just to name two symptoms You re overthinking it Just take it as prescribed and you ll be fine Gabapentin isn t a gaba drug like ambien or klonopin I know cigs are bad for your health but when I heard that the age had been raised I instantly got angry Idk why Maybe because I started smoking a month before my 18th birthday and then on my birthday I bought my first pack of cigarettes I shouldn t have been upset since I can obviously buy cigarettes now but I sympathize with all the smokers who were suddenly screwed I m sorry op I tried to quit a couple times and it was horrible The gum really does help though The patches never did anything but the gum did You ll get through this op It s better that quit now I regret that I ve been a smoker for 14 years ,opioid^black^gum^opiates^opiate

0,0,0,0,None,Opiates arent entirely harmless They wreak havoc on the endocrine system cause extreme constipation which in itself can cause health problems are disruptive to mental health for many people opiates arent as damaging physically as some other drugs are but they arent totally harmless Tweakers look down on opiate addicts opiate addicts look down on tweakers everyone looks down on crack heads and pot heads think they are superior over everyone At the end of the day we re all just trying to get high and get by and instead of judging and hating each other we should have each others backs We already get enough hate from normal people we shouldnt be hating each other You dont have anything physically wrong with you so Doctors arent going to give you opiates its really that simple Doctors dont care that claim you are in pain from your job anyone can claim that they have pain from a job and be given pills if that was the case You need to actually have something physically wrong with you for you to get pills Get a new job and stop trying to use it as an excuse to get pills to get high Opiate addiction or a job No doctor is going to sign you up for opiate addiction cmon now ,opiates^opiate

1,1,1,1,None, Here s a comment https www reddit com r Drugs comments cubvxg please please test your drugs every single time exszez2 about the time I OD d But it doesn t do a whole lot to explain what it actually felt like So I ll do that right now I was addicted to a research chemical opioid at the time I got a new batch did a bump and within 3 minutes knew something was drastically wrong I did the bump started getting high but then it kept going to the point where it was uncomfortable and I didn t feel good Then I pretty quickly started feeling nauseous I spent like a solid hour throwing up even when I had nothing in my stomach When I wasn t throwing up I was sitting on the edge of my bathtub And I remember feeling really tired And my friend would snap at me and try to get me to stay awake And I remember saying something like fuck guys I m just really tired let me sleep But and I realized later if I d gone to sleep I wouldn t have woken up I remember feeling my breathing get really really shallow It was a weird feeling I was too out of it to really process what was happening But in retrospect I m pretty sure I was feeling my body trying to shut down My friends were there with me keeping me awake When I stopped throwing up they d take me outside and walk around with me I remember just being really out of it Almost as if I was really wasted But I just remember being really fucking tired Finally I started feeling better And all but one of my friends left and the one who stayed did so to watch over me while I finally got a little bit of sleep the whole thing started at like 10pm and didn t end until the sun was rising and I had work at 8am to make sure I didn t die I woke up around 7 30am dazed but better But it took a while before the severity of what happened really sunk in If you have further questions ask me or u roreads he was there and he was the one who stayed with me until the morning I owe that fucker my life Yeah man I don t know if you read my original post I linked to but I got super lucky If my friend hadn t showed up when she did I would have done a second bump and been toast Sounds like you got similarly lucky I hate to break it to you man but the vendor didn t shut down his page The market did after he got enough complaints He was cashing out He probably was out of U47 and just sending out 4 FBF until enough complaints accumulated that his page was banned Because and I remember the page was banned But by that time he d already made a fucking profit off shit that was killing people It s absolutely disgusting but that s how the illegal drug trade is And that s how I learned the hard way to always test my shit I hope the rehab goes well I ve been clean from opiates for a little over a year now with no intention of ever going back I hope good things for you man Please always feel free to hit me up if you ever want to talk about shit It s not very often I get to speak to someone who went through literally the exact same thing I did Yeah I understand her faulty reasoning tbh I m sure she was as anxious about the idea of having to call paramedics or go to the hospital or whatever as I was because that s just who she is And yeah I don t necessarily feel bad about her leading that shit because she did a lot more experience with opiates than anyone else plus she dated her ex the EMT She knew more about how to handle that than most people and it was good y all were on the phone with him at the same time too But yeah ultimately kids don t risk that shit I should have taken the narcan at the very least Now I ve got 3 or 4 of those things stashed away despite the fact I don t know anyone who does dope anymore But you can never be too careful ,opioid^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,Nsfw response Oh yeah that s withdrawal symptoms You may even start having wet dreams I am an alcoholic and similair things happened I guess I got so used to orgasming when I was drunk I forgot what a real one felt like 3rd day of tapering I almost passed out I came so hard after 30 seconds My entire body became goosebumps and this pleasureable sensation crept across my entire body as my vision was flooded with staticy colors In layman s terms your body is so used to being numb all the time when it finally begins waking up it goes into overdrive Your libido is suppressed for so long you get a rebound effect Kinda like when you smoke weed for months every day when you eventually quit you experience REM rebound and you have crazy dreams Sorry for the late reply Your sleep cycle is affected by marijuana and a lot of other drug usage Basically you have stages of sleep and the one where your mind is most active is called REM sleep I m no expert on it but it is the stage where dreams happen By missing through drugs or other means this stage you kinda build a debt with your mind The more your body is forced to forgo this stage the longer that stage lasts I ve noticed the effects from not smoking 6 8 hours before sleep but complete sobriety produces the best results It is not pleasant and you ll find yourself waking up constantly at seemingly random times after having the most vivid and insane dreams of your life A 30 minute period of sleep can feel like ages At least that is what happened to me but it is a widely felt phenomenon and a quick google search will show you hundreds of similair stories ,dreams

1,3,1,1,None,Thank you both for the genuine concern I want to to seek out therapy detox and rehab it s just difficult to tell the people in you life something like this when they ve been unsuspecting of it the whole time I know that I ve reached my breaking point I think to myself i don t even want to be doing this anymore as i do it and continue to make excuses It s like i set my mind on the straight and narrow and somehow throughout the day it twists and warps and takes over my actions and i proceed to use these drugs I m deff going to come clean with my mom about where I m at right now She knows about my past substance use and was a user herself honesty she really got me hooked when i sprained my ankle at 14 and gave me a Vicodin for the first time I wanted to feel like that forever she s been clean off her d o c which are benzos and opiates The Apple doesn t fall far from the tree in this case It s my grandparents who i live with I m having a hard time coming clean about this with They are in their late 70 s and completely still all there My grandma is a saint god bless her soul i know i could tell her and she would understand and my grandpa would understand too it s just how disappointed in me he will be and honestly kinda pissed cuz they both have done a lot for me and still decide to choose drugs over everything else Even when they make me blackout and wake up with a broken nose vomit on my shirt and no memory of what even happened the night before NYE 2017 Even when they make me slur and stumble in front of my little brother and sister who look up and adore me Even when they are the sole reason i can not save a dime I always go back to them All to avoid one thing Being alone with myself Descending into the shame guilt and cringe of my past Fearing for what the next day holds and how fucked sideways it will be given to me The weight on my shoulders of 7 digits of student loan debt from one year of university Another effect caused by drugs If i would have focused on school instead of partying I d have a completely different life right now I ve quite fucked my future too for as of now until i get all this debt paid off Oh yes and the sweet sweet ptsd and intrusive suicidal ideation Look at this I m not ignorant or blind or naive to my case I know how about getting myself fixed the steps i need to take to make myself a better man Though i have no motivation to take them Like two sides of my mind battling each other Logic and positivity always seem to lose to depression and impulsiveness That s what makes it worse i wish i was ignorant to this all and blind to how my actions affected my future and relationships with my peers family and ex girlfriends I don t even remember who i really am I also fear sobriety is like a false prophet What if I m still depressed What if i still get those suicidal urges i pray and wish and beg to be banished from my mind for eternity yet they always come back Always Is my life worth living Yes Yes it is There is no question Except for that one that won t leave my head That actually sounds like a nice combo i usually take 25 50mg if dph anyways when using good opiates to keep away the itch I m curious how the dxm added to the experience i might add some into the mix right now I ve taken a couple line of a fent press fake 30 and two Xans thinking about adding 50mg dph and 100mg dxm ,opiates

1,1,1,1,None,It s simple different people react differently to weed It also changes over time For me I smoked weed and loved it never had anxiety issues got pretty heavy into opiates and kept smoking no issues after being clean for a few years still on kratom and still can enjoy weed With all that said I did have times through all this where I could get anxiety or have a bad weed trip from smoking too much in a sitting It s really easy to overdo the weed if you have no tolerance Not saying you should but have you ever just tried taking the tiniest hit of weed In the US biggest reasons for me are it s hard to find a trusted vendor chance of getting inactive or mislabeled powder having to pay bitcoin and waiting for shipping from China Canada and when I can get robocough or extract 5 4g of dxm for about 25 it s hard to justify buying a boatload of powder especially since I don t use it that often Not really After sitting for years the potency may go down slightly but it probably won t be noticeable For example a couple years ago I found 17 years past expiration pharmaceutical opiates they worked just fine Couple reasons firstly its hard to find trusting reviews of your website this post sort of comes across as shilling to me But otherwise Robocough is US based and accepts credit card and has fast shipping Your website accepts bitcoin and ships from china so will take a while Also min order for dxm is 80 robocough min order is like 15 or less And BTW this might break reddits no sourcing rule but not sure x200B Edit per sidebar no sourcing of raw powder this will get taken down most likely Part of me wishes I felt that way from it the other part is glad I don t If I could feel a strong opiate buzz from something as cheap as DXM I would be in trouble Have to recommend Kratom or an opiate Kratom has worked too well for me before to where I could not even finish If you don t take too much you can last as long as you want pretty much ,opiates^china^opiate

0,0,0,0,None,There have been plenty of posts from people here that went CT off of high doses of kratom talked about weeks of grueling withdrawal and sleepless nights only to relapse shortly after they re out of the woods I probably see at least one post per day outlining that exact experience So your tough guy suffering regimen clearly isn t the magic bullet you seem to think it is Statistically people that CT from opiates are several times more likely to relapse than people that use medication treatments to quit You seem to suffer from a specific brand of lack of empathy that I sadly see in a lot of addiction support groups You re the my way is the right way and anyone that does it differently is dumb and wrong guy This post definitely reeks of far more arrogance and misplaced impotent rage than I m accustomed to seeing so I suppose I ll have to give you credit for making the cliche your own This might be news to you but everyone has different pain thresholds Everyone has different experiences For a lot of people the fear of days to weeks of withdrawal keeps them trapped in the addiction well beyond the point they stop enjoying the high Some people work 60 hours a week Some people have children to care for People have responsibilities that they are obligated to and don t have the option of carrying them out in full blown withdrawal If you remove all of the tropes you re SO TIRED OF1 from this sub what would the point of it be You ve basically outlined the entire point of this group so not sure why you stuck around in the first place When you go to bed tonight and are reflecting on your day be sure to think about the fact that you dedicated a huge chunk of time typing out a temper tantrum meant for a bunch of people that are already going through a rough time I hope you are able to work out your anger issues and become someone that has more empathy for others this kind of misguided rage is typically only found in people that are fundamentally unhappy with themselves Probably wouldn t hurt to make an appointment with a mental health counselor Because Fox News tells them that affordable health care will turn us into Soviet Russia or China All they need to do is repeat the words communism and socialism and their audience will clutch their pearls with trembling hands and vote for the guy that cuts their social security and gives tax cuts to billionaires It isn t racist to be skeptical of a government that is committing genocide holding over a million prisoners without cause and trying to wipe out their faith I know that for me at least I m critical of China because I feel horrible for its citizens that are essentially stuck under authoritarian rule This is what I understand about China s government Aforementioned concentration camps and genocide constantly violating the rights and privacy of its citizens through mass surveillance Commits corporate espionage to steal intellectual property and bolster their economy will undermining the economy of other countries Raping and killing protesters If this is all just western racism can you show me independent sources that debunk these things Interesting that you ve been white knighting for China in numerous threads over the last few days That s not suspicious at all ,opiates^china

1,1,1,1,None,You re correct that westerners wrongly assume most Chinese hate their government but are simply afraid to speak out They mostly love the CCP and their newfound prosperity after 100 years of economic misery and constant wars atrocities and colonizations And something like 40 of mainland China is still largely rural where people are poor and uneducated These people don t even think about geopolitics However you would be surprised a lot of Chinese aren t aware of tiannamen square massacre and things like that IMO the government having public support makes the situation way worse They re completely willing to rationalize or overlook their own atrocities and unscrupulous practices as they re ideologically motivated You can say the same thing about westerners blinded by patriotism but the western liberal democracies actually have a semblance of accountability and balance of powers even if it s not perfect You realize trump is the most hostile president to China in history right I have no idea how you could think that Yeah I won t argue that the military like all government programs is disorganized and intentionally obfuscated to hide corruption and overspending and the funding of classified black ops that don t technically exist But there s no way 21 trillion went missing I mean isn t the entire military budget like 1 trillion dollars Edit it s like 640 billion There s no way a number 35 times the budget disappeared I m sorry what There s so much here First of all jews aren t white and nearly every country in the world has a history culture of anti semitism Jews having white ish skin does not matter to any white person White supremicists hate jews more than any other race Also what current laws are against native Americans I m not saying they don t exist but if they do I d like to be educated on that because I ve never heard of that I ll accept china is killing Muslims indiscriminately but the US I imagine you re talking about wars in the Middle East There s a big difference between genociding certain religions in your own country versus civilians dying as a byproduct of civil war It s horrible but it has nothing to do with race or persecution Look at the civil war in Serbia in the 90s or literally any war involving white people ever Civilians die No one is indiscriminately killing those people because they re white just like no white people are indiscriminately killing brown people because they re brown In China they actually are You re right about treating all Latin Americans the same because of the actions of a small minority Same goes for Africa I m a drug addict You know the whole white people using drugs as much as black people but don t get arrested as much is classic correlation causation Hopefully I can speak to this a little bit The obvious reason is that crime rates are higher among impoverished communities and those communities tend to be concentrated with POC those areas with higher crimes also have more policing Putting police where the crimes take place is not racist it protects those communities The implication people make is that police are white supremacists catch white people doing drugs and then let them go because they re white I can unequivocally tell you that is not the case And I hate police as much as anyone Seriously People who do a lot of drugs typically carry drugs with them almost everywhere they go If you re doing other crimes because you re poor you re going to get arrested If the only crime you ever do is take drugs you will likely never get arrested Culturally you know what I ve seen consistently in every country and state I ve ever been to Black people do drugs outside White people do drugs indoors with the curtains drawn Speaking as someone who has done hard drugs with like a thousand people of all kinds and as someone who has been arrested and harassed and profiled many times by cops while being white passing ,china^black
1,1,1,1,None,I m a concrete finisher and yes on the final pass a little water does make it a little easier but it also adds some quality as well You can use a trowel machine to burn the finish and it ends up super hard and more of a black color When I finish by hand with a little water it works up a really fine mud we like to call Aunt Mables Nut Butter lol but it gets into the smallest of holes and blemishes to make a perfect glaze across the top to the point that it shines and you can see a reflection in some places The water actually colors the concrete as well Gives it a beautiful grey finish and can get it so slick you can damn near eat off of it We like to say it ain t finished until you re sharpening you trowel on it Some people think concrete is easy to finish but being able to stay with it and basically rub it until the very last possible minute of it completely setting is a real skill and to me an art I can actually get into that zone where time doesn t register in my mind It s hard work and isn t the greatest on my body but I love knowing that I have one of the oldest trade skills known to man Once I get to a full slick finish like on a basement floor it s already set enough on top to straight up walk or build on The center is still curing though and it is actually still creating heat for up to 48 hours in the middle but the top is as hard as it can get Fun fact the Hoover dam has so much concrete that it s STILL not done curing in the center and won t be for possibly another 50 years at least from what I ve heard I believe they said it s so thick that it ll be curing for over 100 years It s crazy to think about The thing is besides the OD potential opiates are not dangerous drugs There has been no evidence to support any kind of organ damage from prolonged use of opiates alone It s the Tylenol in the lower dose pills that will kill you The line between a healthy dose of Tylenol and compete organ failure is tiny Yet that shit is in every store in America and everyone takes it because it s non addictive Most people aren t ready to have this conversation though so it s whatever but the research is there If someone had a regulated dose of of opium or morphine or pharm grade heroin they could live a long healthy and pain free life The only reason street heroin is bad is because there are unknown cutting agents mixed in Heroin actually originated in a lab made by Bayer It s basically just morphine that has been synthesized to be a lot stronger Morphine is the first drug that is made from the poppy and the most basic besides opium Edit to add to this diacetylmorphine which is the real name of it is still made in pharmaceutical grade labs to this day and can still be prescribed in a hospital It s extremely safe when administered properly Most people die from accidentally overdoses when mixed with fentanyl and diseases associated with bad using practices like hep C HIV and endocarditis I get it Most of that behavior I ve only really seen from people who get on benzo binges like Xanax I ve never seen opiates make people do shit like that and I spent years doing oxy and heroin Now I m not saying somebody in withdrawal won t boost some shit but anyone I ever knew who would rob stores or break into cars and houses were strictly on Xanax That shit will turn you into an animal with no care about anything I never could do that stuff I could literally take some and immediately wake up the next day Knocks me straight out lol Yeah China was already addicted Even the empower was hooked and he outlawed it but the brits said no fuck you you re gonna keep making it and we re gonna keep buying it ,black^opium^opiates^china

1,1,1,1,None,Exactly if you re in a relationship BEFORE your addiction WAYYY different emotional feeling to know you re stressing over getting a fix and if your gf might be ranting or trying to talk about her day you might just nod like you re listening but be crying inside knowing you can t switch that damn thought of I need a pill like shot whatever opiate you do and however you do it I cry to my gf and say sorry once a month over her still loving and putting up with me Fellas if you got a women who has NO idea what opiate addiction really is or feels like but she still loves and takes care of you she REALLY cares about your life and quality as a person Ladies same thing if your guy never struggled with it but is still by your side or even help you get it he loves you as much as it hurts him to grab it It s true facts Even thought my girl gets fed up and if we have a argument go to far and that junkie word slipped out She always said sorry as soon as she realized she was going there I m on subs but I might relapse I m out now and she know and she ll still be here but I still break my own heart continuing this lifestyle I was better than this before I used to do anything for her cause I had money a car 2 jobs Now I have 1 job and most my money goes to bills and subs and if I m out of subs pills are expensive about more than half my money will go to pills then See what true mental things get you into addictive personality Everyone has a crutch I m extremely anxious ptsd And was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago I m only a 20 year old male So no I say fuck ptsd medicine dreams and I say fuck ssris expensive for a chance of happiness I never got So here I am I do benzos and switch which kind I take I never take Xanax Valium kpin phenazepam etc 2 days in a row and he ll if my days going good I have a gf that brings me joy I ll just leave it be Thing is there s a reason we re called recovering addicts Wherever you decided to stop popping pills or doing h or f or scramble You were most likely rock bottom Use that crutch you find to get you out the mental hole and then everytime you REALLY feel a relapse coming on of a drug that destroyed your life Use your crutch weed benzos kratom hell even Suboxone we can actually work and do everything we need to do in normal life I just choose to quit to actually have my own space and piece of mind I knew I wasn t suffering from chronic pain I just switched from my Xanax script to my plugs norcos then perks then morphine and hydromorphone That whole time I wasn t on my meds I need I need to be chilled I m a hothead through childhood Don t like if someone makes a joke about me I feel like I always have to stand up it s the anxiety and ptsd working Now I m on benzos Yes some Friday and Saturday nights I turn in early cause I m on schedule but it feels good to have control over sleep eating and work and money Trust me man I ve been off the everyday pills since end of November suboxone till last week And I m here now battling lil things but happy you ll get there No I feel there s a difference in going into a relationship with opiate addiction and going into a relationship clean then ending up using Your thoughts and heart will play at you if you really love that person it s why I wrote a rant A good doctor would put the fact of that weed causes paranoia into my lifestyle I barely can get by with it anymore on painkillers it was just another thing to bring a high Now it s like ew I don t want a headache sometimes at night when I m on my medicine I do a dab of weed shatter or wax for a good sleep And if a doctor prescribes a chronic pain patient 120 vics 10s every month cause of pain from leg surgeries his education is probably right If a doctor wants me to have 60 Xanax 2s a month for my mental illness s Again education better than yours I wasn t me with out it and when I was first prescribed Xanax my first benzo this doctor did separate visits with psych talkers and therapy always there Never forced it on me if anything told me consequently what could happen with addiction Which is easier for me than opiates I m back and forth from doing it Only way out is suboxone in my opinion Takes the withdrawals mostly away and after a week you can be full functioning on it My advice take 8mg once a day for 3 days then cut down to 6 for a week 4 2 etc and then stop subs before you get addicted to those You can message me I also tell people see a therapist or psych doctor Dopamine interest is different for everyone some people don t have as much as others Same with serotonin happiness There s benzos and ssris and even ptsd medication or just plain sleep medication But a doctor can ask you about your life and figure out why you need a crutch like h to get by although just say you re on opiates not heroin I was figured out to be depressed ptsd and hypertension with anxiety so the manic version Ill admit I m 20 year old male who was prolly raped while I was young by a blood brother of mine So it makes sense why later in life I was confused with feelings and did drugs to ignore or face the fact that I m one of those ,opiate^dreams^opiates

0,0,0,0,None,if you re drinking enough that you get the shakes delirium tremens or on benzos you should talk to a doctor before quitting withdrawal from those two substances can be deadly and best done in the hospital If you are addicted to opiates you can detox at home it s doable but much harder I d suggest going to a doctor and detoxing in the hospital for that too x200B You re going to have to be honest with your spouse about all of this and most importantly honest with yourself Nobody else in theory needs to know x200B Once you ve detoxed I d highly suggest going to a rehab inpatient depending on how severe your addiction is but at the very least an outpatient one In addition to that you need to do AA NA CMA CA any of those they re all the same basically x200B If you really commit to doing all of this you re going to be amazed at how great your life can become in a pretty short amount of time They key is you gotta do the deal you can t half ass this stuff x200B Feel free to message me at any time happy to help in any way I can ,opiates

0,0,0,0,None,I live how African Americans are always listed as one individual like they vote together Here s my opinion blacks as a group are poor and have a lot going on in their lives poor people don t have the privilege of staying informed of every little political thing or where everyone stands They have work and children to raise and thus bigger things to worry about than a bunch of rich white people arguing on stage where most of what they say are lies The other day 3 of the smartest people in the country couldn t identity a picture of Adam Schiff on Jeopardy most Americans are not clued in Sure Biden had more support right now but only because of Obama I guarantee most people who don t pay attention to politics cannot articulate a single difference between the 3 front runners So they support Biden because of name recognition and the media links Biden to a hero of the black community Obama Just like when Obama was elected the narrative is he didn t have black support until he won Iowa no most black people didn t even know who Obama was until he won Iowa because his press coverage BLEW UP My point at last who cares about how much black support Biden has support doesn t matter getting people out to vote is what matters and it s obvious that Biden is not going to get blacks out to vote like Obama did So while they are an important voting block Obama win because he got a lot of blacks to the polls who normally could have cared less about politics We have Trump because Americans are starting to realize that politicians are a ruling class of people who are all currupt Many Bernie supporters something like 20 voted for Trump after he lost the primary If Bernie wins the primary a lit of Trump s support will disappear peole are tired of the establishment I was laughing at the anger over CNNs treatment of Bernie like you people think a multinational company like CNN is going to support a populist who wants to overthrow the elites and brjng power back to the people I m sorry but I m 100 voting for Trump and a good economy before I vote for an establishment candidate like Biden and I guarantee most Americans agree Not to minimize black subjugation but you guys were hardly the first people that were enslaved via the bible Christianity and religion as a whole Honestly almost as long as there has been organized religion it has been used to preach to subjugated people I mean it s core principal that this life is filled with misery and that ONLY by following the laws of those in charge will you get to paradise and that is where real life begins has been used to control enslaved people since it s inception Staged the last thing his campaign wants is for people to realize that a lot of people still don t agree with being gay Like do whatever you do but they don t agree an Especially black and people like Mexicans who are very religious I mean I don t give a fuck who dude loves or fucks but a lot of people do How about closing the borders and now allow any Chinese visa holders in for a set period of time I mean it s lunar New year and a women was already caught going to France infected because she didn t want to spoil her vacation and bragged on social media I know we can close them all the way and ships arrive with Chinese goods and workers daily but if China is going to create this issues they need to be quarantined Eatjng fucking rats and snakes and wolf puppies fuck China your government needs to control everything but could care less about wild game that spreads diseases So 2 studies said 12 and another said 6 but that coupled with those who just skipped the general definitely had an impact Now with a great economy I imagine that this would play out the same this coming election Either way recent reports show Trump with 30 support in the Black Community I know the study is contested but the point remains most people judge a president on the economy because like I said earlier people recognize that regardless of the party in power little actually changes for the average American Over the last 60 years each party has held enough power to do as they wish and little has changed People see Bernie as an outsider and rightly so he doesn t belong in the Democratic party Now as much as I would live to see the reforms he is promoting Congress is still controlled by the elites and like the Republicans with Obamacare it s easy to posture and declare that you are going to do something when you have no power to do so but when it comes to actually voting to eliminate billions in debt or getting rid of a trillion dollars healthcare industry I guarantee they will not vote against the interest of their donors As someone who lost everything to H yeah legalize it a but there is not demand for Fent

3,0,0,0,None,In responding to your post and some of your comments a suboxone taper plan could save you My input as someone who has been on suboxone MAT used it to taper from heroin MANY TIMES and done as much research as a person could do I agree with a commenter above who said to try to taper before giving in completely to a MAT program Suboxone usually comes in 2mg or 8mg If they are 8mg get between 8 10 pills for a 12 14 day taper When you start dosing it start with 2mg and dose another 2mg every 4 hours up to 8mg there shouldn t be any reason to take more than 8mg because of the ceiling I and doctors in treatment centers recommend 8mg split in four 2mg doses for the first four days Days 5 6 7 jump down to 6mg in three 2mg doses Days 8 9 10 jump down to two doses wake up and bedtime of 2mg Days 11 and 12 you ll take 2mg just at bedtime helps with restless legs in the final stretch You can even do 1mg for days 13 and 14 for the final doses Don t take it longer than two weeks The length higher dose you take the stronger it will attach to your opioid receptors meaning the longer more painful the withdrawal will be You will still face minor WD symptoms but it should be off and on chills sweats RLS and stomach upset Nothing unbearable You ve got this Take my advice This method works ,opioid

0,0,0,0,None,First off THANK YOU for introducing us myself to this lesswrong community I found it incredibly fascinating and wholly aligned with my own journey of creating new foundational beliefs systems and rituals for myself perhaps this plays a bit into divination and the timely randomness of happenstance To speak more directly to this essay and your post in general reading through the essay itself and some of the comments I noted how it was elaborated on how divination and I suppose mysticism and ritual as a whole were communal activities a system that essentially encapsulated the superstition of man and the need for a more streamlined and ordered society Is mysticism real Is there merit in a belief in spirit or a higher power or divine cosmic plan An ultimate Ultimate as a favorite writer of mine once said Is intuitive belief or knowing a thing And how does one who calls themselves a skeptic or agnostic in belief or secular as the name of this sub implies come to terms with their use of such traditional divination tools like tarot despite saying it s just a meditative tool I don t know if I wholly believe in the randomness of tarot as noted in the essay comments below it mentioned probability and needing to make sure that your own core and system of beliefs and philosophy aligned with whatever divination system you were utilizing But I have found myself wading between the waters that tarot awakens a suppressed subconscious through its universal imagery and pictorial representation and that maybe more is actually at play Whether I believe that s a greater power I m less inclined to believe But perhaps there is a collective consciousness a biological down to the shared DNA means of connection that evokes a similar call and response in each of us I say that as someone who is a practicing psychonaut a creative and someone who strongly believes in community and the necessity of returning to and creating rituals for mourning for moving forward for celebration etc to get us back to a more grounded and authentic way of existing and being For myself personally I have been using tarot as a meditative tool but I d be lying if I didn t say I don t get a spooky woo there s more at play behind the scenes feeling when certain cards jump out and speak to me or my current situations It feels too uncanny to be dismissive about Some thing that something wants me to pay close attention to or re engage a reassurance of belief in but again is this my own subconscious projecting itself or more And does it really matter I was going to make a post about it and still may about how sometimes tarot cards and their images will come randomly and without prompting into dream I had one such occasion and it is either buried subconscious knowledge or that more I was speaking of but ultimately it doesn t matter The tarot dreams gave me a hope and a shift in perspective I would have never had Maybe sometimes it s best not to so much question the alleged source but instead take the message ,dreams

0,0,0,0,None, Unless the argument is that black people by default subscribe to the apathetic lazy uncouth culture The argument is more complex than that and trying to put that argument in someone else s mouth is disingenuous Thomas Sowell a black highly regarded economist has written extensively on this The explosion of the welfare state in the 1960s reversed so much of the forward progress being made by the black community Single motherhood rates Murder rates violent crime all were much lower rates before the 1960s So the argument isn t that black culture is inherently bad the argument is that black culture has been damaged by govt fixes The 1950s and 1960s were undoubtedly more racist than today yet by almost every metric the African American community was fairing better at the time than they are now What changed https www pennlive com opinion 2015 05 poor blacks looking for someon html Sowell also notes that Such trends are not unique to blacks nor even to the United States The welfare state has led to remarkably similar trends among the white underclass in England over the same period Most of the kids have parent support as far as working hard and aiming for college so the whole black culture is the reason argument doesn t hold water That s kind of a small sample size isn t it Black people are still far more likely to be given harsher punishments than white cohorts who commit similar crimes I have never seen one of these studies that accounts for prior convictions and or parole probation status Also many of them don t account for additional charges or circumstances A person who is arrested for a bag of coke on their first arrest is going to get less time than a person who is arrested with a bag of coke while out on parole with two prior drug possession convictions while carrying a gun Sentencing is crazy complicated and I ve yet to find a study that does anything other than just look at the crimes committed and the sentence given and increased segregation in education and your question is largely answered See page 12 schools have been becoming less segregated in the last 10 years https www nsba org media NSBA File cpe school segregation then and now report january 2017 pdf To your other points those may have an effect but I don t think they negate other causes I ve been discussing ,black

1,1,1,1,None,Definitely go with the methadone Suboxone won t really get you any sort of high it isn t even a full agonist With methadone its a full agonist it s actually a great long lasting high but like anything else you will get a tolerance to it Unlike suboxone you can keep increasing your dose up until a point some people are on huge doses and you may enjoy it to some extent but just be aware that you will be on it all the time your system will be saturated and you won t really get much of a high from it like you are imagining More like you will be mildly high all of the time If you ve ever been on a really long oxy binge to where you take some and hardly feel it because you already have so much in your system it will be kinda like that It will also be a nightmare if you ever decide you want to get off of it They want you on a really high dose so you don t get any cravings and also it destroys your tolerance so you won t even bother seeking out heroin or fent or oxy because it won t even do anything for you and will be a complete waste of money So yeah I would go with the methadone but it won t be like you think In the beginning you might get right off of it and love it but eventually you will likely come to regret it they call it liquid handcuffs for a reason I ve never been on MAT and I ve thought along the lines you re thinking but I realize my addiction isn t so severe I can cold turkey or maintain on kratom and just get high on some opioid from time to time So I can still have that escape and release and enjoyment but just exercise some control over it Like someone else said it is extremely mentally addicting I ve taken breaks before trying to quit and it s crazy I like to listen to music when I shoot or smoke it and hearing a song I used to listen to during that rush would give me that anxiety and sick feeling in the pit of my stomach I would have dreams where I would have a ton of shit but for whatever reason I couldn t get off it seems to be a rule that in using dreams you can t get high It s frustrating just telling you through dreams that you are still wanting it It s not a physical addiction at all it s a pure mental craving that manifests with physical symptoms like the anxiety that you described You aren t physically addicted though don t worry It will go away though don t worry man I feel like it probably took me 6 months to a year eventually it got to the point that I would laugh about the thought of using I realized how crazy it was and had no desire to use at all Then I ended up getting some coke one day and decided to try shooting it and now I m stuck back in that trap Just stay clean try not to dwell on it and the craving and the physical manifestations of the mental craving will eventually be gone You just got to put time between yourself and it and it will get more and more manageable to where you can think about it and instead of dwelling on the rush you can think about the comedown and the money wasted and all of the negatives and laugh the idea away You ll get there if you want to stay clean don t worry it won t haunt you forever Opiates and freebase go together perfectly Freebase by itself can make people horribly fiendish and willing to steal and do horrible things for another hit They opiates and cocaine both have positives and negatives Opiates have no nasty comedown and not as mentally addicting but there is the physical addiction Cocaine especially smoked or injected has a much stronger psychological pull but it doesn t have that physical addiction and once the comedown fades it s not so bad The key is moderation for both And when used together they balance beautifully yin and yang The cocaine spices up the dope and mitigates some of the respiratory depression danger though the cocaine wears off quicker which can cause the opioid to kick back in to dangerous levels when it wears off And the opioid just about entirely eliminates the cocaine comedown and makes it fiend free So I must say they are both bad in their own rights and good in their own rights it just depends on the care and self control of the person using ,opioid^dreams^opiates

1,1,1,1,None,There was one very inappropriately conducted study that showed that a small number of people that were regular low dosage kratom users didn t experience decreasing testosterone during the study It never had a lab from the people before they were users and it didn t explore higher level usage Meanwhile every other study covering opioid use shows a decrease in T Was a complete opiate addict myself Kratom ended up being my drug of choice because of availability Then it actually became something I relied on for the mental health aspect Even on opiates actually more like especially I struggled with depression and anhedonia Kratom took that all away and was way more effective than the Prozac I took for a while Of course that magic fades too On the bright side once you get through kratom withdrawals you will start feeling younger and younger I went form having achey joints that cracked and popped constantly while using and in withdrawal to moving around with no pain I m only in my 30s too My back pain significantly improved after quitting too That one took a while though I can t take NSAIDs so the only thing I can really do for pain is Tylenol acetaminophen paracetamol APAP not sure where you live so I dropped all the names but these are absolutely out of the question for you since you have liver issues My other go to is pain induction TENS unit and capsicum creams they have dollar store ones for a good starting point Don t start with the extra strength stuff or you will regret it induce a little pain and really reduce overall pain Probably an endorphin thing but I won t pretend I know the science of it all Also black seed oil might offer some pain relief but I don t know how it could affect your liver so please ask your doc before trying that one out I never noticed any rebound from supplements but gabapentin had some horrific rebounds This stuff needs to be used very carefully and it s probably good you aren t using it Also I haven t personally experienced it but some people have complained about rebound anxiety after using high levels of kava My impression from their posts is that they were using it to catch a buzz every day and then had problems going without it They didn t seem like people using it intermittently and at low levels just for opioid withdrawal That s funny you mentioned the voice thing My voice has dropped an octive or five since quitting I talked to an ex co worker last week and one of the first things he said is that my voice sounds deeper I hadn t even thought of it before he mentioned it I think everyone is used to my having a high pitched nasally voice from opiates The nasally part is from the constant congestion from either being high or interdose withdrawals That s really unusual And that doesn t seem like enough phenibut to affect your T like that but it might be related Maybe you just need sunlight and exercise to get your system running again Definitely worth getting an endo thyroid panel done just to see where you are at hormonally Also check out DHEA supps because opioid use depletes it and it s a precursor to sex hormones Anxiety cravings and anhedonia are still pretty likely Sounds like you had a pretty short usage time so you aren t going to experience what long term users go through You still seemed of have been pretty lucky as far as acutes go Maybe something you are taking is helping out without you realizing it Either way I don t think you will suddenly get hit with a wave of acutes but the withdrawals definitely aren t done There is also this weird phenomenon of an easy quit I had a few of them over my years of opioid abuse I always took them for granted and the next quit would be miserable Don t take this for granted and start using again or you will for sure regret it Just wanted to remind you that you are tapering an opioid AND an SSRI when you taper tramadol Besides the advice here you could look at the taper and withdrawal subs and other online forums about SSRI cessation Most commonly people talk about Prozac I know how bad those suck too And there are definitely options I would suggest researching don t take without talking with your doctor please 5 HTP as it is a weak and natural SSRI and you can potentially replace the tramadol with that over time Two warnings though You have to taper off of 5 HTP too at some point And you risk serotonin syndrome if you take it while still taking tramadol This is a genuine risk and why I mentioned talking with your doctor I wouldn t have even brought up SSRIs or replacements like 5 HTP if you hadn t been on tramadol so damn long Your PAWS could potentially be drawn out and abnormally difficult Not trying to scare you but I didn t want you getting caught off guard with the feelings I m posting since there weren t too many answers but I can only compare kratom with oxy hydrocodone and opium Kratom is the worst withdrawal for me personally because of the psych meds in kratom The physical part is relatively mild while the anhedonia depression and anxiety are through the roof The physical withdrawals of oxy are the most sharp and intense and the physicals of opium are crazy because of how long they drag on for and what it does to my heart They feel like a month long heart attack and the diarrhea is the worst possible Hydrocodone is a mix of all the above but is actually easy to taper for some reason Kratom will be like a mixture of a really light heroin habit and a moderate to severe Prozac usage level That s how it was to me personally To back some of this up I experience kratom withdrawals even when high on opiates so I know I m not dealing exclusively with an opioid withdrawal with kratom Thank you for the kind words How did the surgery go So my initial pain after surgery was very intense I m certain my tolerance is permanently increased Took probably double the post op recovery meds it would have for an opiate naive person And even worse is I got ALL of the bad opiate side effects from them Nausea dizziness slurred speech etc And no euphoria About 6 hours post op and I was feeling okay The 5mg Norco didn t take all the pain away but it made a huge difference with getting comfortable and getting some sleep I learned a little trick that might help you if when the pain meds aren t helping or available Instead of trying to avoid and distract myself from the pain I focused on it and let myself feel it At first it was worse but eventually it made the pain go way down Loperamide taper will help Caffeine for energy and the lope will combat the increased diarrhea that stimulants like caffeine energy drinks will cause during withdrawal Plus the lope is an opioid and will reduce your WD symptoms anyway Start at 16mg 32mg would be the max and is basically a prescription level of usage and taper down to 0 over 8 days Seems to work well for most people ,opioid^opiate^black^opiates^opium
0,0,0,0,None,OK my husband and I are into age play both in our sexual relationship and in our day to day relationship I like it when after a hugely stressful day I can put on a nightie and some cute plain white panties and drink chocolate milk and watch cartoons Octonauts is my favourite while sitting in my husband s lap It is about caring and being cared for In those times I am completely dependent on him to make all of my decisions for me In a sexual context it is still about being dependent For my husband it is about someone wanting him to teach them about sex not about me being a child but about me having no knowledge about sex and my body and how it all works and why things feel good for example if he starts caressing my labia through my panties I can say daddy why does that make me feel all tingly inside It feels really good Now I need to reiterate that my husband and I are both in our 30s and have absolutely ZERO interest in children whether it s sexual or social or in a parental sense This is a relationship between two people who both gain something incredible from the dynamic Also there is a big size difference between my husband and I He is 6 3 and 105kg 230lb I am 5 1 and 45kg 99lb So it is easy for us to play around with that dynamic Daddy you are so big I don t think that I can put that in my mouth I will choke If there is anything specific you want me to explain feel free to ask ,chocolate
0,0,0,0,None,When I insulted you it was at 3am I was tired and in a bad mood im sorry I do that sometimes The thing I don t get is that the media clearly has a history of blowing things out of proportion Like Deadly Storm Warning then a few gusts go by The media seems to thrive on panic and hysteria that seems to be what sells So how can one then believe that the virus is even worse than what they have been told Also I don t blame people for this but I feel like alot of people on this sub actually want this virus to be big Kind of like getting to sit back at home and watch a real disaster happen from the saftey of their tv pc screens So then those people naturally spread pictures of a dead person lying in the streets of China and claim to know for certainty that the media is lying to them Yea noone knows what is going on inside China But if you look what is happening in other countries you can start to paint a clear picture And there have been zero reported deaths outside China Just a single death would cause headlines because that would show that the disease can spread and everyone is in danger But that has not happened Even though alot of people fled Wuhan over a month ago This disease has had the chance to spread but obviously it is not a threat Listen to yourself Anyone who disagrees with your conspiracy theory is some sort of planted agent trying to brain wash you How many deaths have there been outside of China Or is every country in on your conspiricy Perhaps the global illumaniti have formed a plan to cleanse the globe of the inpure and can control the media and leaders of every single country I am based in Thailand where apparently alot of people from Wuhan fled to Noone here has died there are no dead bodies lining the streets I m sorry this isn t going to be a thing What reality was it I needed to wake up to That is just literally a photo of two dead bodies lying in the street With absolutely no context Also alot of people are crowded around to gawk which tells us this isn t a common sight How does that somehow prove that there is a huge deadly pandemic sweeping the globe I guess if you blindly believed the media who have a clear incentive to write sensational fear mongering articles Maybe if you should stop and consider that noone has died outside of China Zero people Wow you are delusional Yes we know the Chinese are hiding the deaths No You don t know that China is hiding deaths This is just a conspiracy theory that is just as likely to be false And what about other countries Are they hiding deaths too Or is it just cold hard fact that ZERO people have died outside of China Pretty low numbers for a pandemic I must say Also Thailand already started curing patients I m sorry but your doomsday fantasies are officially over Time to wake up to reality dude Because I don t believe that there is some huge global conspiracy to down play this virus I take the virus at face value something that has killed zero people outside of China If you act and think rationally actually look at the confirmed death toll you too will see that prepping for a pandemic is completely over reacting x200B I mean once this virus has run its course a few hundred people maybe a thousand will be dead Meanwhile tens of thousands will have perished from normal pneumonia Wouldn t it make more sense to get all worked up over pneumonia instead x200B edit aaand its been cured already ,china
